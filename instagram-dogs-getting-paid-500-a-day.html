Just like the dance mums, there are pushy pet parents.</p><p>“If we feel someone is in this industry for the wrong reasons or pushing their dog too much, we have to put the animals’ welfare first and refuse to work with them.</p><p>"Thankfully most of our dog mums and dads are just more than happy to see their pets reaching lots of people.”</p><p>Here, four proud owners tell RACHEL SPENCER what life is like when a canine’s career takes off.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Kenny: £650 a day</h2><p>HE was found as a stray aged seven, suffered nightmares and PTSD and has been diagnosed with autism.</p><p>Kenny’s owner Jane Tooms, 50, who adopted him from the Dogs Trust, believes he was previously kept locked away for many years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594575704.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594575779.jpg><p>Now 11, Kenny’s love of routine and sharp focus means he is a great model.</p><p>The Parson Russell terrier has a personal trainer and uses a treadmill, goes to a doggy dentist every six months and has monthly coat strips.</p><p>He has worked with Kit Butler for H&M, plus campaigns for Reebok, Aldi and energy company Equinor.</p><p>Jane, from York, says: “Kenny didn’t have a nice life to start with and was taken back to the shelter many times.</p><p>“But we revolve our lives around him and take him everywhere, including the sports store where we work, so he’s finally settled.</p><p>“He’s a typical scruffy terrier but calm and placid. He loves wearing costumes and can sing on demand, shake paws and do a high five.</p><p>"I’m so proud of how he’s recovered, from having nightmares to being so happy and being a supermodel.</p><p>“It’s like a fairytale ending for a rescue dog.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Barry The Puggy: £200 a day</h2><p>LOVEABLE Barry has worked with Pets At Home, Virgin Media, Sky Bet, Spotify, Firebox and Carpetright.</p><p>Owner Nicole Lane, 32, from Birmingham, works in customer services and spends hours during days off chatting online to his 85,000 Instagram fans all over the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594715520.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594715428.jpg><p>Six-year-old Barry does not know any tricks but is calm and loves posing, so it is always easy to get the perfect shot.</p><p>Nicole says: “I love spoiling him and he has around 30 different harnesses and bow ties.</p><p>“He generally lives a very normal dog life, so his day is made up of walks, cuddles, snoozing – and posing for Instagram.</p><p>“For his fourth birthday we had a pool party for 40 of his friends in a luxury Georgian manor house, with dogs on inflatables.</p><p>“We raised money for Zoe’s Place, a local baby hospice.</p><p>“My proudest moment was a photoshoot for Ava pet food, which is specifically for pugs.</p><p>“He was such a pro and took 20 minutes to get the shot.</p><p>“Every time I go in Pets At Home I look at it and think, ‘I can’t believe it’s Barry’.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Rupert Bear: £500 a day</h2><p>WHEN Rupert the cavapoo hears a camera click, he knows it is time for some tasty cheese or chicken.</p><p>Owner Karen Power, 43, from Portsmouth, says he loves posing and staring into the camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2c8a2f70-646f-49c7-9841-80f65b3665c6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/e1d86ddf-0af9-4c89-a035-5323368bdfc0.jpg><p>She decided to join a pet modelling agency after his Instagram page took off.</p><p>Rupert, three, whose diet is mostly fresh food, has worked with Marks & Spencer, Not On The High Street, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">yappy.com</a> and Fetch.</p><p>Karen, who trained to groom the fluffy pup herself and takes him everywhere she goes, likes to “twin” with him, meaning they have 30 matching outfits.</p><p>Rupert, who has 25,000 Instagram followers, has a further 100 bandanas and bow ties of his own.</p><p>Karen says: “We got Rupert after my children had grown up and he is my world.
