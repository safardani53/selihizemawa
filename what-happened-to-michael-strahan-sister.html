He has captured the hearts of millions from being on the show, even though he was an NFL star long before he traded his shoulder pads for tailored suits every morning. So, when he was absent from Good Morning America in September 2020, fans were concerned.</p><p>Sadly, Michael’s dad passed away, leading him to need the time off to spend with family and grieve the loss. But with the news of his dad’s death came questions from viewers about the rest of his family, including his older sister, who died in 2019. Michael has four kids of his own, but even before he became a dad, he was already part of a big family and as Good Morning America’s sweetheart, it’s hard not to wonder about them too.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Michael Strahan's sister?</h2><p>Debra Strahan was 10 years older than Michael and, like him, she was from Texas and they had remained close even though Michael went to live with an uncle to hone his athletic abilities as a teenager. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Debra's obituary</u></a>, she died in March 2019 at the age of 58 as a dedicated church-goer and the memorial photos posted on the obituary website feature Michael alongside her.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't list a cause of her death and Michael has never spoken out about it. In fact, although he has mostly spoken about his parents and their support for him, he hasn’t said much, if anything, about his siblings over the years. That doesn't mean he isn't close to his family because the Instagram photos featuring him gushing over his "Mama" say differently. But the cause of Michael’s sister’s death was not released to the public.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Man, the love and support in Houston was unbelievable.

Because of the sudden loss, he took some time off from Good Morning America to deal with it in private. A cause of death has not yet been announced and Michael himself hasn't released an official statement about his father’s death, but his Good Morning America co-hosts did pay tribute to him on the show.</p><p>"We wanted to take a moment to say our thoughts and our prayers are with our colleague Michael Strahan and his family," co-host Amy Robach said on-air. "His father Gene Willie Strahan Sr. is being laid to rest today. He was born in 1937... the first of nine children to receive a high school diploma. Enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1955, Gene rose to become a major and serve with the 82nd Airborne Division."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Throwing it back to a young ME!

And even though Michael is from such a large family, his talents as an athlete and, eventually, a television host, were never overlooked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>by his parents</u></a>.</p><p>"I never knew I could accomplish so much," Michael told People magazine in 2016. "But my parents never act surprised. They look at me as if there’s no limit. That helped me feel like there’s no limit."</p><p>It was likely his dad’s mentality of setting his mind to something and doing it rather than shying away from it that helped get Michael to where he is today. And although he has been dealt multiple blows in the form of losing loved ones close to him, Michael seems to remain optimistic about what else life has in store for him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSmoZOdrqa4jKyrq5mYlrtuv8isq56q</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cheap-gucci-belts.html><span>←</span><span>Cheap Gucci belts: our guide to saving money on the must-have accessory</span></a>
