Several media personalities, including Robin Roberts and Stephen Colbert, also made appearances.&nbsp;</p><p>The state dinner comes after Biden has been working on improving the United States’ relations with France, as he has openly said via Twitter. “France was our first ally. The first country to fly the American flag after our Revolution. The first to host our diplomatic post. But more than anything — France was our first friend,” Biden wrote.</p><p>Some of the food items served at the dinner included caviar, butter-poached lobster, Calotte of beef, and a watercress and sunchoke salad, per&nbsp;CNN.&nbsp;Keep scrolling to see photos of Jill, Joe, Jennifer Garner, and other celebs at the event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZLewsYyboJ2dnmLAta3TnmSdoZ6jsrN5z6GmraejZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-does-francesca-farago-make.html><span>←</span><span> How much does Francesca Farago make?
