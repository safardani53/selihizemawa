In the photos (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen here</a>), the brunette bombshell added a wide-brim sunhat, oversized sunglasses, and a few gold bracelets to her ensemble. J.Lo wore her giant diamond <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding ring</a> from hubby <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>.

Prior to her island getaway, Jennifer took to Instagram to show off a pink <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>one-piece swimsuit</a> over the Fourth of July weekend. “Hope everyone had a great holiday weekend filled with love, family, friends and fun,” she captioned the sexy carousel of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>poolside photos</a> at the time. She completed her plunging swimsuit with gold hoop earrings and a matching gold nameplate necklace.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Most recently, Bennifer went viral online after the&nbsp;Gone Girl&nbsp;star was pictured <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>checking his phone</a> during a make out session with J.Lo on December 21. The duo was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photographed</a> shopping at Maxfield in West Hollywood just days before Christmas when the PDA moment took place. Jennifer was photographed packing on the PDA with her man while he was tuned into his smartphone. A few days prior, Jennifer stunned in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sequined green gown</a> while hosting her Christmas party and singing holiday classics at home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5FxZqOdnqO2p7HRZqOoqJWverO7wqSqZq%2BYnsGmedKtqaKml2KvqrfIp6BmrJ%2Bleqq6jKyrZpqRp8G0ec%2Bhpq2no2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-porter-jr.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Michael Porter Jr. net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
