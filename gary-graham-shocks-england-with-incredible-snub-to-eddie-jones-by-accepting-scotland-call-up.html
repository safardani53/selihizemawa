In an incredible snub, the Newcastle Falcons back-row turned his back on the Red Rose, 10-months after being given a shot by Eddie Jones.
Stirling-born Graham qualified through residency and angered his dad and ex Scotland prop, George, by doing so.
After his surprise call-up earlier this year, Graham said: &#34;I would f***ing love to play against Scotland, make 1,000 tackles and shove it in their face — but it might have to wait until next year."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
