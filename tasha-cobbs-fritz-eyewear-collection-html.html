The singer was very close to her dad, so her goal was to create a collection that would express her dad’s life motto, “Love Everybody.”&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fritz Eyewear Collection focuses on creating unique and&nbsp;fashionable eyewear&nbsp;for both men and women to enhance their facial features and assist their personal needs.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Curve Athletics was launched to promote body positivity and self-love for curvy women. The collection was created keeping plus-sized women in mind after Cobbs worked on it for over three years.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The apparel line comprises exclusive pieces that are structured with a breathable and supportive high-end fabric that provides both comfort and style. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In a recent interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Forbes</a>, when asked about building a body-positive business empire, the musician replied she had done considerable research and eventually released her first collection. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Also, she added that she was inspired to create a separate apparel line dedicated to curvy ladies after she couldn’t grab even a single piece when plus sizes of Beyonce’s Ivy Park clothing were first launched.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>I reached out to some manufacturers reached out to Kiki, actually who have a plus-size line, and I started asking her some questions. And I found a manufacturer, and we released our first collection. And people just started jumping on it. And so now we have curve athletics and it is really, really growing. I love, love, love, love it.</p><p>Moreover, in the interaction, she talked about how four years ago, she decided to start the eyewear business as an honor to her late father, who was their family's pastor.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I literally pray over every frame. I'm very involved. My husband and I, we do shipping, we are answering emails, you know, I believe in building from the ground up. Business is one of my passions. I'm passionate. I'm an entrepreneur. I love it.</p><h2>Fritz Does Digital Marketing Through Celebrity Endorsements</h2><p>The eyewear brand seems to be a hit not just among her fans but also in celebrities’ social circle as they are spotted donning exclusive items from Fritz Eyewear.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Fritz has taken the most common marketing route in the digitalized world through&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">social media</a>&nbsp;and celebrity endorsements.
