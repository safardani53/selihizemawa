The recurring bit was about two music-obsessed teenagers who talked about history while knowing nothing about history. Throughout the sketch, their father would come upstairs and ask them to turn their music down.</p><p>The characters created by Ed Solomon and and Chris Matheson went on to become the subject of their own comedy that was released in 1989, starring Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves as Bill and Ted, respectively. The rest, is, well, history.</p><p>The incredibly successful film spawned a sequel that is actually as good as the original (a rarity), a cartoon series, merchandise, and heck, even its own breakfast cereal. Fans are also excited that, 30 years later, Keanu and Alex are reprising their roles for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill and Ted Face the Music</a>, the third installment in the series.</p><p>So what keeps a franchise going strong for decades? Unforgettable performances don't hurt, and neither does the fact that it's genuinely funny. In fact, it's packed with tons of quotable and meme-worthy moments that hold up in any era.</p><p>Buy Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Like when they quote "Dust in the Wind" to Socrates.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Telling the world's greatest philosopher a quote from the world's greatest band named after Kansas is quality cinema, ladies and gentlemen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Or when they met themselves from the future, but needed some proof.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It's the only way they could be sure.
