Your diet could be missing these ingredients</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>If you're having issues with sleep then it could all be down to your diet, one expert says.</p><p>Nutritionist Gail Madalena, who works with <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">PureSport</a> said you may benefit from specific natural ingredients.</p><p>Combined, she said the below ingredients can help the mind to switch off, and the body to enter into a deeper, more restful sleep.</p><p><strong>Magnesium</strong>: Gail said mineral magnesium is essential for hundreds of cellular reactions in the body, plus it can also help the body to relax. You can get magnesium, she said, from foods such as dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, pumpkin seeds and almonds.</p><p><strong>Chamomile</strong>: There is research to suggest that the flavonoid apigenin, found in the plant extract chamomile, could help calm the mind. explains Gail. A mug of chamomile tea before bed can be helpful, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> suggests that a mug of chamomile 45 minutes before bed can help you nod off.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>L-theanine</strong>: This amino acid may not be essential for our body, but it can be useful in altering the levels of certain chemicals in our brain. Gail explains: "The chemicals serotonin and dopamine have an effect on our sleep, and these are the chemicals which L-theanine can impact."</p><p><strong>Cannabidiol</strong>: Growing in popularity, <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> on CBD suggests that it could help improve sleep.&nbsp;It’s a popular treatment for insomnia too and is said to have the ability to relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression, both of which can hugely impact our ability to sleep.</p><p>But they said the most noticeable and common physical symptom is puffiness around the eyes due to water imbalance.</p><p>"You will also very likely get dark circles (‘bags’) under the eyes. This is due to the blood vessels dilating.</p><p>"Your sex drive can plummet after just 24 hours of sleep deprivation, due to being too exhausted to feel aroused.</p><p>"Because your body is struggling to cope with exhaustion, you will likely have an increased muscle tension, which can cause tremors", they added.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>If you still want to have a drink but don't want to have the consequences of a hangover or vivid dreams then there are things you can do.</p><p>"Try and limit yourself to just a few drinks, avoid that extra Sambuca shot and make sure to get a good night’s sleep", the experts added.&nbsp;</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Traveller shares VERY strange method to sleeping on flights - but people love it</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIFygZBtZ2tnopqurXnRnpisp55ixKa10Z1kr6GmnrFusNGemKarXZe8sMbIp55o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lung-cancer-christmas-text-blunder.html><span>←</span><span>Shocked GP patients get text telling them they have lung cancer instead of Merry Xmas message</span></a>
