Jersey Gateway National Recreation Area park.</p><p>Though Bruce claimed he only <a href=#>had two shots of tequila</a> before riding, the officer noticed that the 750 ml bottle of Patron was completely empty.</p><p>Due to his altered appearance, the cops then asked the Jersey native to go through a field sobriety test.</p><p>The results elucidated that the performer was swaying and took 45 steps when asked to take 18.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

to the international star reached out to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NY Post</a> earlier today to give insight on the situation.</p><p>The insider explained that a group of fans noticed the father of three on his bike, and asked him to stop for a photo.</p><p>After taking a few pictures, they "offered him a shot of liquor which he took while sitting on his bike,&nbsp;which was stationary," the source explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

drove away."</p><p>The insider also claimed that Bruce's blood-alcohol level was 0.02 at the time of arrest, heaps lower than the New Jersey legal allowance of .08.</p><p>The Rock and Roll legend was cited for <a href=#>driving while intoxicated,</a>&nbsp;reckless driving, and consuming alcohol in a closed area.</p><p>As this was Bruce's first DWI, the Thunder Road vocalist was allegedly cooperative with the police.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

part in Jeep's Superbowl Commercial campaign.</p><p>The promotion featured the Born in the U.S.A. singer offering words of unity to the American people.</p><p>The advertisement aired during the game on Sunday, and Bruce urged viewers to &nbsp;"meet in the middle"&nbsp;in order to dispel the socio-political tension that has plagued the country of late.</p><p>While driving an old Jeep in the dead center of the country, he urged civilians to find a common ground "between freedom and fear."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
