Some were fortunate enough to have never heard of him before <a href=#>his video mocking Japanese suicide victims</a> went viral at the beginning of the year.</p><p>For a while, they’ve been rumored to have been dating. And it is with heavy hearts that we confirm that this is true.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>On Wednesday, one concerned fan’s question was able to confirm a mildly disturbing rumor.</p><p>"Hey @chloebennet," a fan asked on Twitter. "I’m seeing rumors you are dating l*gan p*ul? just wondering why you would do that"</p><p>Note that this was the fan’s censorship of Logan Paul’s name, not ours (though that censorship can be a smart move on social media).</p><p>Celebrities don’t always respond to questions about dating rumors, even when they’re true. But Chloe did reply.</p><p>"’Cause he’s kind, creative, funny, vibrantly curious about life, weird as f–k in all the best ways, a big dork, and he’s one of my best friends," Chloe replied.</p><p>"It doesn’t make sense to a lot of people," Chloe admitted in the same tweet. "But it doesn’t have to. He’s changed my life for the better and I’ve done the same for him."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Some may be wondering why someone would censor Logan’s name in a tweet or why people would ask why any self-respecting person, particularly a woman of Asian descent, would date him.</p><p>The Twitter user who asked the question in the first place explained in a pair of follow-up tweets.</p><p>"I should have included the context within which I was inquiring: considering his past anti-Asian racisms," the tweet reads. "I ‘censored’ his name so that I wouldn’t have to deal with his stans (so its non-searchable) eating my ass bc I don’t actually like them."</p><p>That same Twitter user also responded to the answer that she received, writing:</p><p>"I appreciate that @chloebennet took the time to respond with her side of the story," she tweeted. "I don’t like him any more than I did before, but this is her life and her choice — that’s the end of it."</p><p>That is a very healthy point of view.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In case the revelation on Twitter wasn’t enough,&nbsp;</p><p>TMZ‘s cameras caught <a href=#>Chloe and Logan</a> out and about in Beverly Hills, where they confirmed their relationship with a high five.</p><p>After what has apparently been some time of secrecy, they’re finally dating out in the open.</p><p>This might be alarming for a lot of Chloe’s fans, but … even though she’s a public figure, how much of this is their business?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Is Logan Paul a human garbage fire? Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>Over a month after the widespread controversy over his video in Japan’s infamous "suicide forest,"&nbsp;<a href=#>he filmed himself tasering a dead animal</a>&nbsp;for some reason.</p><p>His behavior was so bad that YouTube once again suspended his ads.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, folks, YouTube is a site whose algorithms often lead impressionable teens to Nazi recruitment videos. If you’re not meeting their content standards, you’re either&nbsp;really&nbsp;bad … or showed some forbidden nipples.</p><p>But that does not mean that Chloe Bennet does not get to make her own decisions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We’re inclined to say that the Twitter user who asked her has the right idea when they write "this is her life and her choice — that is the end of it."</p><p>Besides, who among us hasn’t dated or&nbsp;hooked up with a hottie with a terrible personality and struggled to justify our decision to friends?</p><p>You don’t have to like Logan Paul to support Chloe’s right to follow her own path.</p><p>And Chloe absolutely should not be held accountable for her boyfriend’s bad behavior.</p><p>Also, despite my frustration, this reminds me that I really should catch up on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&nbsp;</p><a href=#><img width=2560 height=1821 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes-scaled.jpg alt="13 Celebrity Relationships We're Pretty Sure Were Fake" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>13 Celebrity Relationships We’re Pretty Sure Were Fake</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WEcK%2FHpaaeZZKau6%2Bx02abmqyZo7RussCmnJ1llKTCpLTEnJinp5ViubCzwKdkqZmloXqnu9FmqqillWK%2Fpq3SqKVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./criminal-minds-beyond-borders.html><span>←</span><span>Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders - Watch on Paramount Plus</span></a>
