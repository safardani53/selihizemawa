Let’s do this …</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/michelle-young-pre-rose-ceremony-827x1024.jpg><p>To learn nearly everything that happens between The Bachelorette premiere this very night, and the final rose ceremony, just follow the jump …</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span>The great <a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>Reality Steve</a> has done it again. Using his remarkable pull with unnamed inside sources, he’s got big time dish on Ashley’s entire season.<p>The man is never wrong, either. Well, except for when he is in fact wrong, despite insisting that he is 100 percent not wrong. Which is sometimes.</p><p>What can you do. He gets fans one heck of a lot of info with regularity, and does catch his own mistakes by the end. All you can ask for and then some.</p><p>So, let’s give credit where it’s due and give it up for Reality Steve!</p><p>His site has much more information, but this is what’s important. Here are the 18 gents who survive the premiere and vie for Ashley Hebert:</p><li>Ben Castoriano: 28, New Orleans</li><li>Chris Drish: 25, Chicago</li><li>Ryan “Mickey” McLean: 31, Ohio</li><li>Bentley Williams: 28, Alpine, UT</li><li>Blake Julian: 27, Greenville, SC</li><li>Ben Flajnik: 28, San Diego, CA</li><li>Nick Peterson: 26, Tampa, FA</li><li>Stephen D’Amico: 27, Manhattan Beach, CA</li><li>William “Will” Holman: 30, Fostoria, OH</li><li>West Lee: 30, Columbia, SC</li><li>Lucas Daniels: 30: Odessa, TX</li><li>Constantine “Dino” Tzortzis: 30, Cumming, GA</li><li>Ryan Park: 31, San Luis Obispo, CA</li><li>Ames Brown: 31, New York, NY</li><li>Jeff Medolla: 35, St Louis, MO</li><li>Matt Colombo: 28, Ameherst, MA</li><li>Ryan Miller: 27, Michigan.</li><li>JP Rosenbaum: 34, Long Island, NY</li><p>Now for the rundown on who survives subsequent episodes:</p><p><strong>Episode 2 (down to 15)…</strong></p><p>1-on-1 date: Will Holman. Will gets a rose.</p><p>Group Date: At the Monte Carlo hotel with 12 guys. The twelve guys are split up into two teams of six. Bentley gets the rose on this group date.</p><p>1-on-1: Mickey McLean. At the Mandalay Bay, they got a private concert from Colbie Callait performing her song “I Do”. Mickey gets a rose.</p><p>Eliminations: Matt Colombo, Stephen D’Amico, and Ryan Miller.</p><p><strong>Episode 3 (down to 12) …</strong></p><p>1-on-1: Ben Castoriano. Flash Mob Video date in Pasadena, California at the Americana at Brand outdoor mall. Whatever that means. Rose given.</p><p>Group Date: 10 guys in the first “Bachelorette Roast.” Basically, the guys do stand-up comedy directed at ripping on the other guys – and Ashley.</p><p>Will gets a bit carried away and apparently spends an inordinate amount of time making fun of Ashley. Nice. Ryan Park gets the rose on this date.</p><p>1-on-1: JP Rosenbaum. Low key date, just dinner at Ashley’s place. Rose.</p><p>Eliminations: Chris Drish and Jeff Medolla. Bentley Williams eliminates himself after his group date, saying he misses his daughter and can’t stay.</p><p><strong>Episode 4 (down to 11) …</strong></p><p>1-on-1: Ames Brown. At some point, they end up sitting at the edge of the water in the sand in their bathing suits. Ames gets a rose, obviously.</p><p>Group Date: At a local orphanage where the guys are building and painting stuff all day for the kids. Ben Flajnik, the artistic one, gets the rose.</p><p>1-on-1: Constantine Tzortzis. Rose.</p><p>Elimination: West Lee.</p><p><strong>Episode 5 (down to 8) …</strong></p><p>1-on-1: Ben Flajnik. They go shopping at an outdoor market, visit an ancient Temple, then enjoy Thai music, dancing, and fire eaters. Rose.</p><p>Group Date: Eight men compete against each other in Muay Thai boxing, tournament style. Ryan beats Ames and accidentally gives the guy a concussion, sending him to the emergency room. Blake beats Lucas.</p><p>Constantine beats Nick. JP beats Mickey. Constantine and JP bow out. Blake and Ryan have one final match. Blake wins, then wins a rose.</p><p>2-on-1: Ben Castoriano and Will Holman. Both are sent home.</p><p>Eliminations: Ben Castoriano, Will Holman and Nick Peterson.</p><p><strong>Episode 6 (down to 6) …</strong></p><p>Bentley reappears! However, he doesn’t return to the competition, doesn’t go on dates, and isn’t part of the rose ceremony. He appears to talk to Ashley about … something. But the end result is that he is sent back home this same week.</p><p>1-on-1: Lucas Daniels gets a rose.</p><p>Group Date: Three 2-man teams competing in a dragon boat race. Long story short, Ryan ends up getting the rose on this group date.</p><p>1-on-1: JP gets a rose.</p><p>Eliminations: Blake Julian and Mickey McLean.</p><p><strong>Episode 7 (down to 4) …</strong></p><p>1-on-1: Constantine. Rose.</p><p>1-on-1: Ben F. Rose.</p><p>Group Date: Ames, JP, Lucas. JP gets a rose.</p><p>1-on-1: Ryan. He gets sent home on this date.</p><p>Eliminations: Ryan Park and Lucas Daniels.</p><p><strong>Episode 8 – Hometown Dates (down to 3) …</strong></p><p>The lucky four fellas who get to go home with Ash:<strong><br></strong></p><ul><li>Ben Flajnik (Sonoma, CA).</li><li>Constantine Tzortzis (Cumming, GA).</li><li>JP Rosenbaum (Long Island, NY).</li><li>Ames Brown (New York, NY).</li></ul><p><strong>Hometown Dates and Season Finale – Who Wins?</strong></p><p>Ames Brown is eliminated after the hometown dates. Constantine Tzortzis is sent home after the overnight dates just before the season finale.</p><p>The final two, from what we’re hearing now, is Ben Flajnik and JP Rosenbaum. A pair of worthy competitors, to be sure, but only one can win.</p><p>That person is JP Rosenbaum. That’s right. JP Rosenbaum and Ashley Hebert are engaged! Will it last? We’ll find out after the August 1 finale.</p><p>Will these predictions prove correct, or did we miss the mark? Check back for updates and Bachelorette spoilers galore throughout the season!</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 5/25</strong>: The first night’s 18 survivors checked out according to the spoilers provided. Now it’s about to get genuinely interesting.</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 5/30</strong>: There is chatter about Bentley Williams and his exit (then return) to the show, but we can’t confirm it yet. Stay tuned.</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 6/2:</strong> So far, so good with the intel … and so bad when it comes to Bentley Williams. What a slime ball, are we right ladies?!</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 6/6</strong>: We’ve added the alleged winner of The Bachelorette, JP Rosenbaum. See above. Will this prove correct? We shall see …</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 6/8</strong>: As predicted, Bentley left the show of his own choosing in the third episode. But wow, no one could have predicted the way he did so.</p><p>With his dot dot dot garbage, Williams left the door open for his return, which we’re hearing takes place in the sixth episode of the season.</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 6/14</strong>: Still going strong. Ashley changed the rules by asking for another rose so she could only axe one guy, and was granted it.</p><p>Sucks for West Lee to be the only guy kicked off, but that’s where we stand. Next week, three guys will have to pack their bags and leave.</p><p>As for the return of Bentley, the previews imply he will return next week. However, spoilers suggest it will actually be the following week.</p><p>It’s possible they will talk about how he has returned, but the actual meeting between Ashley and Bentley won’t take place until week six.</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 6/21</strong>: Yup, Bentley is coming back next week. He cast a long shadow over the fifth episode but did not actually appear. Yet.</p><p>The three eliminations were just what the spoilers predicted, leaving the current field at eight … plus whatever you’d consider Bentley.</p><p>Don’t worry, though. He’s gone for good next Monday.</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 6/28</strong>: Wow. What a display. Bentley came all the way to Hong Kong to replace that “dot dot dot” crap with a period. So lame.</p><p>As predicted, Blake Julian and Mickey McLean are gone, although the latter actually eliminated himself in the wake of Bentley’s return.</p><p>That was something of a surprise twist. In any case, we’re left with the final six Bachelorette contestants we’ve expected from the start.</p><p>From what we’ve learned, there will be no new episode July 4. New episodes will resume July 11, with the finale still set for August 1.</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 7/12</strong>: The final four hometown dates are set, just as outlined above. Will be an interesting couple of weeks to say the least.</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 7/19</strong>: As predicted, Ames is gone. He didn’t take it well. In fact, it didn’t seem like he even knew how to process it at all.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the previews for next week, another surprise guest shows up in Fiji. Don’t worry, this time it is not Bentley Williams.</p><p>We’re hearing that Ryan Park is the returning hopeful, and that he appears AFTER Constantine takes HIMSELF out of the competition.</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 7/26</strong>: Ryan was allowed back to ask for another shot for some reason. After some hilarious visuals, he left dejected again.</p><p>Constantine did in fact withdraw from the show, saying he would not go to the fantasy suite with someone he wasn’t in love with.</p><p>That leaves Ben Flajnik and JP Rosenbaum, as predicted all along. Will the big winner be validated next week on the season finale?</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 7/31</strong>: With the finale set for Monday night, here’s what we know about last episode of the season and its aftermath:</p><p>JP meets Ashley’s family first, and her sister Chrystie is really, really hard on him. She prefers Ben, who meets the family second.</p><p>At the final rose ceremony, Ben gets down on one knee and proposes to Ashley, who eventually shoots him down. Ben is shocked.</p><p>He walks away, surprised and despondent, and she chases after him, but he’s not too receptive. JP then arrives and he proposes.</p><p>She says yes. On the After the Final Rose special, Ben is still upset and surprised. Ashley and JP are still engaged and happy, though.</p><p><strong>UPDATE, 8/1</strong>: Check out our LIVE recap of <a href=#>The Bachelorette season finale</a>!</p><p>As always, stay tuned …</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2ppX2WCcMDHnmSbmZOdsq270Z6rrZ1dqL2wtcueqaxlkai1rbHYZp%2BempWnwW6%2F1KKrqKqjYsCkrc2dmKWrXZa7pXnFoqVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-victor-ortiz-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Victor Ortiz Dating Now</span></a>
