Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Emily Simpson has been honest about her health struggles over the years.</h2><p>During an appearance on SiriusXM's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Lewis Live</a>, Emily revealed that she underwent liposuction surgery after noticing drastic changes in her weight. She recalled receiving an unrecognizable photo of herself from a RHOC producer, which prompted the need for lifestyle changes. “I don’t know what happened. I think I just went for four months hard when we were filming and I ate too much, drank too much, and just didn’t get enough sleep, didn’t exercise,” she explained.</p><p>Emily recalled feeling “very depressed,” as she was later deemed pre-diabetic. The mother of three went on to try Ozempic, under the guidance of her doctor. Emily suggests that the drug served as a “kickstart” to her weight-loss journey, which also includes healthier food choices and regular workouts. Emily also admitted that she had liposuction in January and is satisfied with the results.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Emily got COVID-19 while filming Season 16 of ‘RHOC.’</h2><p>Fans of RHOC may have noticed that Emily was missing from the July 5 episode of the show, and her absence was due to her health. Emily explained in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video message</a> that she wouldn't be attending the cast trip to Montana because she tested positive for COVID-19. The star said that she didn't have any symptoms but didn't want to expose her castmates.</p><p>In response to the news, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans</a> took to social media to question why the network requires COVID-19 tests, while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">others</a> suggested that Emily was simply trying to avoid not going on the trip.
