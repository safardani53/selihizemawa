You're my favorite character, and I'm not just saying that because you're sitting here."</p><p>"Are you fangirling right now?" co-host <a href=#>Dylan Dreyer</a> asked Craig, as he sputtered that he was "watching these clips" as footage from Yellowstone played during the discussion.</p><p>But then the clearly flustered Craig made a bit of a blunder right after that.</p><p>"But Kayce, I mean, do you watch the show?" Craig asked Luke, referring to him by his name in the show, Kayce Dutton.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE today">READ MORE today</h2><p>"Did you just call him Kayce?" Dylan asked Craig as both she and <a href=#>Sheinelle Jones</a> busted out laughing.</p><p>"It happens all the time," Luke assured Craig with an easygoing grin. "It's fine."</p><p>Immediately after calling Luke "Kayce," Craig did it again, but the TV star was unfazed.</p><p>At the end of the segment, Craig was apologetic for calling him by the wrong name.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>This flub comes just as co-host <a href=#>Savannah Guthrie</a> admitted to <a href=#>having a "crush" on Luke</a> while he stood just inches from her.</p><p>"Got a huge crush on you!" she said while hiding her face.</p><p>"OK bye," she added as she ran away from him, hiding behind meteorologist Dylan.</p><p>Dylan was quick to call out Savannah's behavior at the time as "creepy" and noted how the star was blushing profusely.</p><p>"I know because I do have a big crush on Kayce from Yellowstone, or whatever your real name is," Savannah said. "Hi, Luke Grimes!"</p><h2><strong>AL-LELUJAH</strong></h2><p>All this comes as <a href=#>Today</a> fans were thrilled to see the return of beloved weatherman <a href=#>Al Roker</a> to the morning show on Friday.</p><p>Savanna and <a href=#>Hoda Kotb</a> introduced Al as he made his way onstage.</p><p>The pair held back tears as they embraced Al.</p><p>"It's great to be back," he said, while holding their hands.
