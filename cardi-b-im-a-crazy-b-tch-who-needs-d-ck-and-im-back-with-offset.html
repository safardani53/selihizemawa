And I’m telling Offset, ‘Yo I feel like…,” she said before explaining how her topless photo ended up on her Instagram Story.</p><p>“I’m taking the f-cking picture and then I f-cking press and I see that it’s loading and I’m like ‘Oh my God! Oh my God, Offset!</p><p>"Oh my God, the picture’s loading,’ and he was like, ‘Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Cardi proceeded to explain that she asked the Migos rapper to check her Instagram Story from his phone to see if she had, in fact, posted the NSFW photo for the public to see.</p><p>He confirmed that she shared a “picture of the f–king tit!”</p><p>Oops!</p><p>But also, whatever.</p><p>“By the time I turned my phone on and deleted that s–t, everybody and their mom saw. They were all over the internet," said Cardi, adding that she used to be a stripper… so she didn’t really care.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As for why she ended up back in bed with Offset? And what this says about their relationship?</p><p>“I’m just a crazy bitch,” Cardi explains in a new video, confirming the divorce is off.</p><p>“One day I’m happy, the next day I want to beat him the fuck up," she added.</p><p>Moreover? Come on, folks. Did you really expect Cardi to go celibate, for any period of time?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"It’s really hard not to talk to your best friend, and it’s really hard to have no dick," she continued.</p><p>"We’re just really typical, two young motherfuckers who got married early, that’s what we are.</p><p>"We’re not no different than y’all fucking dysfunctionnal-ass relationship. We are the same way."</p><p>In this same video,&nbsp;Cardi also casually claimed she’s not bipolar and even took a test to prove it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So there you have it.</p><p>Cardi B was horny and does not have a mental health problem and obviously doesn’t care what people think when it comes to her marriage.</p><p>Might as well let her go and be (temporarily) happy with Offset in that case, right?</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2Z9cK%2FAq5uiZZJitq55wGaaq5mqrnqjedOcn2avmKR6r7HEnapmnF2YuG6tzZ1koqVdl66kt4ywoK2gXaSzp7%2FErWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./courtney-stoddens-mom-krista-keller-marries-reggie-salazar-photo-20141512.html><span>←</span><span>Courtney Stodden's Mom Krista Keller Marries Reggie Salazar: Photo</span></a>
