The 3-bedroom, 2-bath property comes in under 2,000 square feet and sits on about an acre, but the Gainesian details make up for the modest stats.

On the show, the homeowners picked up the 1-bed, 1-bath, 1,000-square-foot property — expanded from the original 750 with the addition of a loft — for just $28,000.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-shotgun-house></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The "Shotgun House"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Picture It Sold/Carol Embry</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sellers weren't looking for a full-time resident, however. Instead, it was pitched as "an investment opportunity," said Roberts in 2019. "It is walking distance to the [Gaineses'] Magnolia store and the Silos" and Baylor University's football stadium. The house was listed on the home-sharing site Airbnb, and, Roberts noted at the time, "has stayed rented at over 90% occupancy."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5ikuqZ7xK%2Bcq7FdmLWqvIyapZ1lmqSur7rAZp6aoZ6awG6yyLGcq2Wlpb2mvoyhpqadXaS7bsDHnmSmmaKgsrV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-sara-cardona-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Sara Cardona Dating Now</span></a>
