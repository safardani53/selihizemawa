He seemed to be of good behavior until he forayed into a different business endeavor. Earlier in August, he announced he wanted to make a name in the cryptocurrency space. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">launched his non-fungible tokens</a> or NFTs and suggested that his company would “change the game.” NFTs are assets that can be bought with cryptocurrency. In simple terms, NFTs is&nbsp;like collecting art, but only digitally.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>NFTs can be anything from artworks, images, audio clips, videos to any random thing you do or find on the internet. NFTs allow creators to digitize their work so that no one can replicate it, and some are worth millions of dollars.</p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Paul</a><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> introduced the world to an NFT based game called CryptoZoo, where ‘zoo’ owners can trade, collect, and breed exotic hybrid animals.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In an IMPAULSIVE Clips video, Paul seemed confident about the success of his venture and revealed that he invested millions based on his confidence.</p><p>Bro, we have a massive team behind it and are probably out-of-pocket like a million, just because we believe it’s gonna work.&nbsp;</p><p>Even before its release, CryptoZoo had over 5000 unique holders.</p><h2>Logan Paul Called Out on Twitter for CryptoZoo</h2><p>And just when it looked like all the hate for the social media star was ending, he got into trouble again.&nbsp;The NFT project initially received a lot of hype thanks to Paul’s fame, but he went viral on Twitter recently after a user called his project a scam. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Paul’s CryptoZoo has come under fire for allegedly using photoshopped Adobe Stock images.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>A Twitter user named&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Coffeezilla</a>,&nbsp;who described himself as an “internet detective exposing scams,” exposed Paul with a side-by-side comparison photo of a stock image of a panda alongside its CryptoZoo variant.&nbsp;</p><p>He also shared one of a penguin and another of a lion. Although the truth has not been established, Paul’s art looked suspiciously similar to the stock image. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“DON’T SUPPORT THIS CLOWN PROJECT. My guy is literally ripping off stock photos and their “admin” Ben Roth is lying about it in the telegram," he said.</p><p>Many users responded to Coffeezilla’s claim, noting that Paul would never change and that he was a scammer.&nbsp;So far, Paul has not responded to the accusations.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSfnK6vec%2BarKVlnpvBb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-sb737-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is SB737 Dating Now</span></a>
