With fashion at the forefront of the characters’ personalities and storylines, the show has dictated trends for some two decades now, and no one had quite as much impact as <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker’s</strong></a> Carrie.</p><p>Rocking a tube top (or two) along the way, Carrie became known for her center-parted tousled mane and the blingy nameplate necklace she sported throughout the show’s six-year run. SATC costume designer Patricia Field later shared that she suggested the idea of Carrie having a signature accessory to SJP early on, and the actress ensured the personalized design became a part of her wardrobe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/carrie-bradshaw.jpg><p>Flash forward to 2018 and everything old is new again. Throwback ‘90s style is a favorite of It-girls like the <strong>Hadid</strong> sisters, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong></a> and Sofia herself. While tube tops had seemingly gone the way of butterfly clips and were gone forever, the stretchy style (whether in a bandeau or cropped length) is having a moment, just like all the other cute styles from the decade. And while nameplates arguably never went anywhere, having one show up on Sofia’s Insta all but guarantees we’ll be seeing a lot more of them very soon.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When it comes to the center parted ‘do, the simple styling shows off the the model’s sun-kissed beauty, and her minimal makeup and her-lip-but-better pout is the perfect monochrome addition that we know Carrie Bradshaw would approve of.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6i8p7XAZqmim5iesrR5wpqpq6GVYq%2BzrcOsn5qvXZ67tLzIq5ydZaSqr6Z506inZqaRorKxuMCtnGagkZ6%2FbrzInKpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-mamula.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Mamula</span></a>
