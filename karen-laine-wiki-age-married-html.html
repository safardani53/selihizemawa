But for some reason, Laine's first three marriages didn't work out well.</p><p>She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was</a>&nbsp;first married to Casey Starsiak, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon. She met him in the '80s and went on to start&nbsp;a family with the&nbsp;three children she shared with him. However, their relationship didn't work well and they got divorced. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>You Don't Want To Miss:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Jordyn Woods Wiki: Age, Parents To Weight Loss | Kylie Jenner BFF Bio</a></p><p>Moving on as a single parent&nbsp;to three children, Laine then married Randy. She gave birth to a&nbsp;daughter named Kelsy with her second husband. The relationship also didn't&nbsp;work, and they parted ways.</p><p>After that,&nbsp;Laine <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a>&nbsp;Mick, her third husband. But, much like her previous relationships, this one also led to a dead end.</p><h2>Karen Laine's Fourth Marriage Is Blissful; Says Husband Is 'Best Man in the World'</h2><p><span>Love hurts when you're not with the right person, but&nbsp;one should never&nbsp;give up loving. Just ask someone who never gave up: Karen Laine! Despite facing failures in her marriage on multiple counts, she once again got back into romance space.&nbsp;This time, she married a man named Roger.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Staying&nbsp;reticent about the marriage, she never precisely revealed anything about the marriage ceremony. But&nbsp;on September 23, 2020, Laine&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took</a>&nbsp;to Instagram&nbsp;to&nbsp;confess&nbsp;that the-very-day was her anniversary. Posting a picture of herself and her husband, the&nbsp;Good Bones star also&nbsp;mentioned she was "married to the best man in the world!"&nbsp;</p><p>After facing numerous heartbreaks, the TV celebrity has finally found her man. On November&nbsp;29, 2020, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> a glimpse of her married life, where her husband was installing custom tiles.</p><p>In the caption of the pictures, she used a hashtag, "Ifoundmyperson." Though a little late, Laine is indeed enjoying a happy marriage in her life now.</p><h2>Karen Laine Ran 'Two Chicks and a Hammer' With Daughter&nbsp;</h2><p>The Indiana native is a former defense attorney. Using her field knowledge, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">collaborated</a>&nbsp;with her real-estate agent daughter, <a href=# rel=follow>Mina Hawk Starsiak</a>, to reinvent disfigured homes in Indianapolis.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, the&nbsp;mother-daughter duo's relationship as business partners seemed&nbsp;to have&nbsp;worked out&nbsp;as they not only gained a lot of fame but also established themselves as the owners of a home-remake business called&nbsp;Two Chicks and a Hammer.</p><p>The business was established in 2014, and the work done under its banner was showcased in an HGTV show by High Noon Entertainment. In July 2015, the show's first season premiered with the name Good Bones. The series completed its fifth season in 2020, a year after Laine retired from the job. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Karen Laine's Net Worth</h2><p>A former attorney-cum-businesswoman, Laine has her hands in various businesses. Unknownst to many, but she also played&nbsp;in award-winning movies&nbsp;Darkman (1990),&nbsp;Back to the Future(1989),&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shocker(1989). Understandably, fans have long been curious about the reality star's net worth.</p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Max Riemelt Has Partner Amid Gay Rumors?
