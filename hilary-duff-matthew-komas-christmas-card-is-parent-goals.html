The married couple, <a href=#>who wed in 2019</a>, are tied up by a string of LED lights. Duff’s son, <a href=#>Luca</a>, is spotted “tightening” the makeshift rope. The 10-year-old, whom t<a href=#>he Disney Channel alum</a> coparents with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Mike Comrie</strong></a>, teamed up with sisters<a href=#> Banks</a>, 4, and <a href=#>Mae</a>, 21 months, to complete the caper, however, the girls were more interested in <a href=#>eating cupcakes from their seats</a> on the floor. (Duff and Koma welcomed their daughters in 2018 and 2021, respectively.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Hilary-Duff-and-Matthew-Koma-Hilarious-Christmas-Card-Laura-Moll.jpg><p class=p1>“Happy Holidays, all is not calm,” a note on the Christmas card read. “A Duff, some Bairs and a Comrie.”</p><p class=p1>Duff’s family <a href=#>holiday portrait</a> quickly impressed her celebrity friends. “It was a good card&nbsp;<span class=s1>🔥</span>,” <a href=#><strong>Lisa Stelly</strong></a> wrote via Instagram comment.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>How I Met Your Father&nbsp;</i></a>star and Koma — real name Matthew Bair — celebrated <a href=#>their third wedding anniversary</a> earlier this month. “Matthew. I love you so much. I don’t know if you knew what you were getting into or that you weren’t going to sleep or sit down for the next 5-10 years but I think for the most part you’re pretty happy about it,” she gushed via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in a Wednesday tribute. “Our life is so full and I’m over the top grateful for the guy that I got to do all this madness with.”</p><p class=p1>Duff first became a mother in 2012, when she and the 42-year-old hockey star <a href=#>welcomed Luca</a>. While the twosome eventually split in 2016, they’ve <a href=#>remained amicable coparents</a>.</p><p class=p1>“[Luca and I] talk about [Mike] often,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>A Cinderella Story&nbsp;</i></a>actress <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Grazia&nbsp;</i>in a May interview</a>. “I like to tell him about how I met his father, about the good times we spent together, about the greatest joy when I found out I was pregnant and how his father and I coped with pregnancy. It is a very sweet thing.”</p><p class=p1>Duff eventually moved on with Koma before <a href=#>welcoming their two daughters</a>. As the former child star and the rocker raise Banks and Mae, Duff has also <a href=#>created a tight-knit circle of mom friends</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Hilary invited me, blessed me with that opportunity and I owe her my life,” <a href=#><strong>Meghan Trainor</strong> </a>exclusively <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in August of the group</a> that includes Duff, <a href=#><strong>Mandy Moore</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ashley Tisdale</strong></a>.<i>&nbsp;</i>“Every day I’m like, ‘Be cool, be cool, be cool.’ It’s been, like, a year and a half, and I’m like, ‘Be cool.’ [My husband, <a href=#><strong>Daryl Sabara</strong></a>, and I are] acting as we’re there trying to be very cool about it, but we’re freaking out.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “This is where <a href=#>we escape work and we just hang and chill</a> and talk about our baby, what’s weird [and what’s] happening this week.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGahoZyWv7p5w66dn2WdlsG1tMSwZKSnnZbAbq%2FHq6CsrJ2WwG6vwKubZqGjYr2ivsSnq2afn5a5tHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./agnieszka-radwanska-nude-photos-spark-outcry-in-poland.html><span>←</span><span>Agnieszka Radwanska Nude Photos Spark Outcry in Poland</span></a>
