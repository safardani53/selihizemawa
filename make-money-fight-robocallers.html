That's how she finds out the company's real name.</p><p>The Doc Compton kit provides demand letters and once she figures out where to send it, she sends one off demanding the robocaller to pay her.</p><p>Robocalls are illegal unless you give a group permission to call you. It's also illegal to call numbers on the Do Not Call List.</p><h2>Things to keep in mind</h2><p>Doc Compton, consumer advocate and creator of Turning Robocalls Into Cash Kit, said: "Believe it or not these guys want to negotiate."</p><p>"They don’t want to go to court because it, number one, exposes their identity which they don’t want, and then also too, it kind of opens the door for the feds to go in and examine their call records and their business practices.”</p><p>The Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act states robocallers can be liable for between $500 and $1,500 for every call.</p><p>If you log more calls from the same company, a bigger paycheck will come your way.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it's important to note that there are caveats to the law.</p><p>For example, you need to have been called twice in the same year by the same company to bring a claim.</p><p>Secondly, you have to sue to recover money - which means you may incur legal costs - although some companies just settle after getting a demand letter.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>We tell you about other scams out there including an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon phone scam</a>.</p><p>Plus, why the <a href=#>FBI had to investigate</a> 3million robocalls.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>RHOSLC cast is swarmed by cops before Jen Shah's ARRESTED for 'telemarketing fraud scheme' in chilling season trailer</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfaX11fZBtZ2ilkaCybrnOp5yyZZaetKnAjKumm6eTlrmtsdGsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./martin-s-schwartz.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Martin S.
