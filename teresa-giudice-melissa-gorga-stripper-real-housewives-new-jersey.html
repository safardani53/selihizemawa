And she said hi and she acknowledged him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“When Teresa and Melissa went in the bathroom, Teresa said, ‘He said you were a dancer,'” continues the source. “Melissa flips, calls her husband. Her husband, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Joe Gorga</a></strong>, flies in like a&nbsp;lunatic … went after the owner physically. He had words with the owner of the boutique and accused the owner and Teresa of setting Melissa up. Ridiculous. She is what she is and everybody knew it there. People who had danced with her were there.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Teresa and the owner of the boutique had no involvement with getting Melissa’s former boss to the show. “He bought the ticket because he knows the people from the salon,” assures the source.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“First of all every one knows it,” says the insider. “Joe used to go there [to the strip club]. This was common knowledge. For him to blame the owner [and Teresa], go to the show and accost the owner … for them to act like that made them seem more guilty.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The source adds that everything that happened as the fashion show will play a major role in the plot of upcoming season four &nbsp;— and it will possibly be the focus of the season four finale!</p><h3>– Lindsey DiMattina</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>More RHONJ Stories:</strong></p><li>Teresa’s Husband’s Intimate Dinner With Another Woman!</li><li>The Real Reasons Why Teresa’s Cast Mates Hate Her!</li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Teresa’s Husband Joe Giudice Involved In Cheating Scandal: Will They Split?</a></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlhZH5xe5FqZq2doprAonnGoqydoZOaeq6xy6KqrJldnLyzs8Bmqq2qmaW9pr6Mq5yapF2dvLa%2FxLCgr52jYrumw4yjnKurla58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miley-cyrus-sleepover-kiss-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Miley Cyrus Leaked Photos - The Hollywood Gossip</span></a>
