He and his team were in the thick of the virtual action, but then some knocks and loud noises from outside of AngelWalks' room began coming in through his microphone. The knocks then became even louder and when the streamer left the game to go see what was going on, he was met with truly horrifying news.</p><p>His family rushed to tell him that his brother Roberto Perez was lying cold in his room — he was dead. Shocked, AngelWalks returned to the room a few minutes later, apologizing to everyone on the feed, alerting them of the news. "Guys, I’m sorry. My brother just died. I have to go."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>He ended the feed summarily after making that statement to go and spend time with his family and make arrangements for Roberto's funeral. He didn't explain the causes behind his brother's death or any of the other circumstances around his passing. Soon after, he did take to Twitter to further discuss the emotional implications of losing Roberto.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I was in the middle of the gauntlet when my family came to my door panicking, yelling that my brother was cold and not moving.
