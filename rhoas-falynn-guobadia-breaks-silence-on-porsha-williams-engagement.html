The interesting thing about life is that it is an individual journey.”</p><p>Simon included photos of the happy couple and offered a close-up look at the Dish Nation host’s engagement ring.</p><p>“We travel this road not lightly considering we have being in relationships that have thought us to want and do better for ourselves,” he continued. “I asked her to marry me because we checked ALL of each other’s boxes, and then some.

This mutual decision was not made lightly, and despite our current willingness to be transparent, we only ask our friends and supporters to be respectful of our privacy as our family gets through this very difficult period.”</p><p>The couple wed in 2019 after three years of dating. Falynn is the mother of three children from a previous relationship, while Simon is the father of five kids.

Even to those who are undeserving,” she captioned a sultry photo of herself via Instagram on Saturday, May 8.</p><p>Williams, for her part, has been engaging with positive messages from fans about her big news. After someone on Twitter suggested that Williams should have her wedding filmed for Bravo, the New Celebrity Apprentice alum replied with a simple, “Maybe.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BWwG6ywKWwp6ZdnMKwrsCdoJplkqeyorfSZqqipJWjsKZ5zqdkqaeiqLWiedaio6WhkaLAbrHNoJignZ2au7V7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-frankie-jonas-married.html><span>←</span><span>Is Frankie Jonas Married?
