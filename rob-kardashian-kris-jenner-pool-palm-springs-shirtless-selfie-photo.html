Of course, this meant spending plenty of time by his mom’s pool, where the occasional Keeping Up with the Kardashians&nbsp;guest star snapped a few photos. One of them included a shirtless selfie that he posted to Instagram on Aug. 3, which highlighted his toned shoulders!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Rob borrowed a quote from The Dark Knight Rises for his caption. “I didn’t see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!,” the Kardashian man captioned his fit selfie, which also featured him sporting a <strong>Los Angeles Rams</strong> bucket hat. His sister, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>, left a heart-eyed cat emoji underneath the handsome shot, and fans left similarly kind compliments underneath the photo.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Looking good Rob stay strong and positive,” one fan wrote, and another commented, “Looking great! Keep up with your happiness :)” Fans have been gushing over Rob’s recent fitness transformation, which he has been showing off in recent photos here and there (such as ones taken at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Khloe Kardashian’s</strong> </a>36th birthday party, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>this selfie</a> of his flat stomach).</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“Rob is feeling so much better about himself, he’s taking care of himself and it show. “His whole outlook is better. He’s eating right and living a healthy lifestyle and it’s made a big difference in his state of mind,” a friend of the Kardashian family EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> at the beginning of July. With that said, our source added, “Now that he’s feeling like himself again, he’s way more open to love and ready for a new chapter.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>For the most part, though, Rob has been spending time with his family throughout his quarantine. He often posts photos of his adorable daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dream Kardashian</strong></a>, 3, whom he shares with his ex-fiancée <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Blac Chyna</strong></a>, 32. He has also shared photos of Kris and his little sister, <strong>Kendall Jenner</strong>, hanging out by the Malibu beach house owned by socialite <strong>Diana Jenkins</strong>, where the KarJenner family has been retreating for idyllic summer days.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH15e49sZqunkmK4or7DmqqhoZGjeqy%2ByKxko52eo7Kzec%2BopqVloJa5rnnSqamippeoerS0yKurpZ2jqHq0scufoJ5loJ28tbuO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kurt-coleman-rugby-union.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Kurt Coleman (rugby union) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
