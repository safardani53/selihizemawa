Normally we’d say these two have been through a lot together, but in this case, Ryan has been the one creating 100 percent of the drama, and Maci has been the one coping with the fallout.
As you’ve likely heard by now, Ryan was arrested once again last week after he relapsed and threatened to murder his wife, Mackenzie Standifer."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Hell, I haven’t got to spend any time with him, just me, in a long time,” said a tearful Ryan at one point.</p><p>“Hell, I just miss him. There’s a lot of times I wasn’t there just to see him play ball, just putting myself first.”</p><p>Ryan pled for compassion, noting that he might be able to have a better relationship with his son if he didn’t “have to deal with everything else that I’ve had to in the past, just everyone else in the way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I just looked at him and I could see the pain and honestly I felt like I was staring at Bentley,” Maci responded.</p><p>“It’s obviously bittersweet, but I really appreciate the vulnerability and the ownership, where he maybe came up short, what he could have done differently,” she continued.</p><p>“Everything he was committing to, it just felt little by little, a breath of fresh air, because it would absolutely make Bentley’s heart so whole.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Bookout then made it abundantly clear that Bentley’s love for his father remains undiminished.</p><p>“Ryan, there’s a part of Bentley that is hurting, he loves you so much and there is only one person who can help that hurt and it’s you,” she said.</p><p>“He wants a relationship with you more than anything else.”</p><p>Maci was then asked about ways that she might help Ryan improve his relationship with Bentley.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I think one of them is making sure that I’m keeping Ryan all the way in the loop as it pertains to anything Bentley has going on, so he as the option to support and be there,” she said.</p><p>Maci then acknowledged the elephant in the room, noting that she and Ryan have often had “trouble communicating with each other respectfully.”</p><p>“I agree, I said some things that were hateful. Yes, I’m sorry for that,” Ryan said.</p><p>“I also want to apologize for not putting in more of an effort to understand the battles you were fighting and struggles you were going through,” she chimed in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I should have treated you more like a human being and if I could go back and do it different, I definitely would, but I’m going to do it different moving forward and I’m sorry.”</p><p>Had it not been for the events of the past week, the segment would have left us feeling hopeful for Ryan’s relationship with Bentley.</p><p>As it is, however, the conversation is just a sad reminder of what might have been.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2V%2FcLnAnKBmmp%2BkuLDB02aZnp%2BjYr%2B6rc1mnJ2vkaextHnTqGSbnV2XsrXAxKtknZmUYq6utcNmpZ6vXZavtr%2FEZqqcmZ6Zrq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./loreens-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Loreens Boyfriend: Who is Loreen Dating?</span></a>
