The 44-year-old rapper claims the retail giant has copied his designs to the detriment of his fashion empire and is now seeking damages.
Court documents state an &#34;unauthorized exact copy&#34; was made of the $75 shoe by Walmart - only to be sold at $25, a fraction of the intended price.
The papers obtained by TMZ also detail how the Foam Runner was introduced in 2019, before making its official debut in 2020, selling out straight away."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
