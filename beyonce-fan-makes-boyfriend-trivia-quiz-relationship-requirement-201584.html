That was the question obsessive Beyonce “stan” <strong>Allie Davis</strong> (<a href=#>@Fergyonce</a>) was trying to answer on Monday, April 6, when she quizzed her boyfriend on the most important questions in life: detailed <strong><a href=#>Beyonce</a></strong> trivia.&nbsp;</p><p>“I gave my boyfriend a Beyoncé exam to make sure we can stay together. He passed,” she tweeted along with pictures of the questions and his answers.&nbsp;</p><p>I gave my boyfriend a Beyoncé exam to make sure we can stay together. He passed. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Lqv3VEKWFx</a></p><p>— Yoncé (@Fergyonce) <a href=#>April 6, 2015</a></p><p>Like most tests, the questions were split up into different part-itions, and the future <strong><a href=#>Jay Z</a></strong> to Davis’ Beyonce had to score a 60 percent or higher to stay in their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>It started off simple, asking the beau to name three Beyonce songs, and got more detailed when one question asked, “Briefly explain the <strong><a href=#>Solange Knowles</a></strong> elevator incident. Who was involved? What was the public’s reaction? Did Beyonce respond to the incident?”</p><p>???? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zgl1YbwSDe</a></p><p>— Yoncé (@Fergyonce) <a href=#>April 7, 2015</a></p><p>Davis’ boyfriend wrote, “a billion dollars and Jay Z got punched.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Beyhive member peppered in some questions about her other favorite artists including One Direction, Jay Z, and <strong><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a></strong>. But the majority of the points were reserved for Queen Bey. Luckily Davis’ man scored an 80 percent, proving their futures will be filled with drinking watermelon and riding surfboards.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after she posted the test, it started getting picked up all over the Internet. Davis noted that some readers even got aggressive.</p><p>“I swear some of y'all need to find your chill and maybe a sense of humor…sending death threats over a Beyoncé joke? Pls,” she tweeted.&nbsp;</p><p>Before and after OTR. Truly a mess. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Dusdk6CRPF</a></p><p>— Yoncé (@Fergyonce) <a href=#>August 6, 2014</a></p><p>Some critics bashed her for leaving her relationship up to chance, but Davis replied, “The Beyoncé test literally took 5 minutes to write and I did it because I was bored and I like to mess with my boyfriend… PSA from my boyfriend: ‘I knew this was a joke from the beginning, and sometimes we love to pester each other.’”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After the news went viral, Davis posted a “create your own” <a href=#>Beyonce exam</a> on her blog, and later made a <a href=#>detailed mock resume</a>, writing, “Beyoncé, here is my resume, I am applying for Beygency President.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> Would you give this quiz to your man?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnamku6SxjJ%2BYp2Wdlrimv4ybprKeop6yr7CMramirpmWerLByLNkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXaeyssHIq5ymnZ6penN8kG5vbWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./standing-dartboard.html><span>←</span><span>7 Top Rated Standing Dartboard</span></a>
