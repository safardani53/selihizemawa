Malo Gusto was out of position and way out of his comfort zone as a makeshift left-back when he is more right-wing than Jacob Rees Mogg.</p><p>But the bigger worry was that it wasn’t just along Chelsea’s left flank where they were exposed time and again.</p><p>Boss Pochettino’s expensive but fragile team was getting done all over the pitch by a Championship side determined to make the most of a big day out to play with energy and confidence.</p><p>Silva’s absence was keenly felt and it must still be a concern that Pochettino had to turn to his ageing star to bring the game to a successful conclusion.</p><p>Backed by 5,500 noisy fans, <a href=#>Preston</a> dominated the atmosphere inside Stamford Bridge while the team controlled the game without producing many serious threats on goal.</p><p>It was an uncomfortable ride for the first hour for Chelsea, who always look there for the taking no matter the score or the opposition.</p><p>Rewind one week when they turned a 3-0 lead with 20 minutes to go into a backs-to-the-wall finish for 3-2 at Luton.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to that, it took a last-minute penalty to beat struggling Crystal Palace.</p><p>There were chances for <a href=#>Sterling</a>, Fernandez and Palmer in the opening 45 minutes in which Chelsea should have taken the tie by the scruff of the neck.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/armando-broja-chelsea-scores-teams-870183029.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/thiago-silva-chelsea-scores-teams-870184005.jpg><p>But each one was squandered and petered out amid loud jeering from the packed away end as the ball either rolled wide or was dealt with by Preston keeper Freddie Woodman - godson of England boss Gareth Southgate.&nbsp;</p><p>Chelsea finally broke the deadlock when Gusto was at last able to turn on to his trusty right foot and pop a cross into the area. There, 6ft 5ins Broja rose to skilfully glance a header across the face of goal and into the opposite corner of the net.</p><p>When <a href=#>Silva</a> came on, Chelsea returned to a more familiar shape with Gusto on his favoured right side and it was more assured from then on.</p><p>The former AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain star claimed earlier this week that he never fancied life over here because he feared it was all high balls and no Samba style.</p><p>Yet his debut goal in the <a href=#>FA Cup</a> was a classic English set-piece as he dashed to the near post to head Palmer’s centre into the net at speed.</p><p>That was the death knell for game Preston who understandably crumbled.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Sterling thumped his free-kick from the edge of the box past Woodburn.&nbsp;</p><p>And with five minutes to go and after much VAR deliberation, midfielder Enzo Fernandez was adjudged onside when he rolled home a deflected Sterling chip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/enzo-fernandez-chelsea-scores-teams-870187204.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/enzo-fernandez-chelsea-celebrates-scoring-870187449.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-preston-north-ends-jordan-870182980.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH92fpZrZ2poX5i1prjSnphmqKKawLW7zWadmmWTqr1w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./al-villanueva.html><span>←</span><span>Al Villanueva [2024 Update]: Contract, Stats, Anthem &amp;amp; Wife</span></a>
