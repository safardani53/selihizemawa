Whether they show off their curves in skintight black trousers, or opt for a high-waisted pant with a pop of color — we’re looking to our favorite celebs for inspiration on how to rock the trend. Be it for a glam dinner out on the town or just going for a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daytime rocker look</a>, these ladies are the epitome of slaying the style.</p><h2><strong><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></a> flaunted her killer curves in a pair of stylish, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>high waisted leather pants</a> in two glam Feb. 18, 2021 Instagram photos. The fitted trousers hugged her body to perfection, and she couldn’t have picked a better choice for a top. Xtina, 40, wore a skin-tight light purple turtleneck with funky, darker purple pattern across it. The garment was likely a bodysuit, as it tucked into her leather pants with ease and showed off how tiny her waist is these days. With her fun <strong>Chanel</strong> Rubik’s cube style purse and glam hair and makeup, the mother of two looked like she was heading out for a night on the town.</p><h2><strong><strong>Iggy Azalea</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Iggy Azalea</strong></a>&nbsp;changed up her rapper aesthetic for rocker chic in two Apr. 12, 2021 Instagram photos. She could be seen in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tight black&nbsp; leather pants</a> with silver stud accents on them. The 30-year-old matched them with a body-hugging black tank top with red trim around the neck and shoulders. It was pretty clear the brand she was wearing, as the tank had “<strong>Christian Dior</strong>” spelled out in intricate red lettering. The look was purely for fans, as Iggy seemed to pose against a wall at home in the outfit.</p><h2><strong><strong>Larsa Pippen</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/larsa-pippen-pvc-pants-leather-mega-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Larsa Pippen</strong></a>, 46, rocked a pair of black PVC bottoms while grabbing dinner with her daughter and a friend in Beverly Hills. The former Kardashian BFF was snapped on July 29, 2020 looking incredibly chic in a brown, monogrammed <strong>Fendi</strong> top, a sparkly protective face mask, and black open-toe heels.</p><h2><strong><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kim-kardashian-pvc-pants-leather-mega-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Like Larsa, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, 39, has also been known to rock leather pants, and she stepped out in New York City in October 2019 wearing a form-fitting pair of trousers. She paired them with a black leather top which featured embroidery of a dragon and and a high neckline. Surprisingly, she opted to wear a pair of flip flops as she walked beside her then-husband <strong>Kanye West&nbsp;</strong>on their way to Milos restaurant.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Of course, that wasn’t the only time she’s rocked the trend. Kim stepped out in Hollywood on July 10 and opted to wear skintight high-waisted black leather <strong>Vex</strong> pants. The crocodile embossed pants hugged her curvaceous frame perfectly and she paired the pants with a black cropped <strong>Tom Ford</strong> crocodile top. She topped her outfit off with a pair of clear PVC ankle-strap sandals and left her short bob down and straight. Kim looked super toned in this skintight outfit and it was the perfect sexy look for a night out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kim-kardashian-black-snakeskin-outfit-spl-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Other celebs who have rocked the trend include <strong>Kendall Jenner</strong>, 23, and <strong>Sophie Turner</strong>, 23, who have both tried out the look in their own unique way. One star that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cannot stop wearing leather</a> pants is Kendall, and the supermodel has rocked them on multiple occasions. Kendall stepped out in New York City on May 11, and put her insanely toned torso on full display when she rocked baggy black <strong>Mugler High-Waisted Straight Leg Leather Trousers</strong> paired with a tiny wife beater tank top that she cropped all the way up to her chest. Over her tiny top, she donned a sheer black and white button-down <strong>Acne Printed Shirt</strong>, topping her look off with a <strong>Louis Vuitton Graffiti Pochette Accessories Bag</strong> and <strong>Ray-Ban Oval Flat Lenses</strong> sunnies.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Another one of our fave supermodels who loves the look is <strong>Bella Hadid</strong>, 22, of course. Bella flaunted her enviable figure in a full monochromatic, brown leather ensemble at the 2019 Variety Power of Women Luncheon in NYC on April 5. She wore a skin-tight buttery brown <strong>Rosetta Getty Fall 2019 Pintuck Leather Flare Pants</strong> with a matching <strong>Rosetta Getty Strapless Top</strong> and a <strong>Rosetta Getty Tailored Leather Blazer</strong>. She topped her leather look off with <strong>Vhernier Creole Earrings</strong>, <strong>Dmy by Dmy Olsen Sunglasses</strong>, and see-through <strong>Gianvito Rossi PVC & Patent-Leather Pumps</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>Sophie Turner</strong> looked fabulous when she tried the trend at the Louis Vuitton 2020 Cruise Show which took place at the TWA Flight Center at JFK airport, in New York, on May 8. Sophie, who is a brand ambassador for the high-fashion designer, <strong>Louis Vuitton</strong>, looked gorgeous in a pair of bright red baggy, leather trousers which had tight cuffed ankles with gold button accents. She paired the leather joggers with a black and white cropped tweed jacket, which featured a striped ruffle neckline, and a leopard patterned stripe down the front of the jacket, which was cinched in at her waist with a rope tie belt.
