It took the jury nearly 12 hours to find Willis guilty of first-degree premeditated and felony murder and the sexually-motivated kidnapping of Heeringa.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On April 16, 2013, Heeringa, a 25-year-old mother of a 3-year-old boy, had been working the night shift at a gas station when a customer arrived at 11 p.m. and found the station abandoned. Heeringa’s purse and jacket were still in the gas station, but she was nowhere to be found.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the gas station managers told police that she was driving by the station when she noticed a suspicious silver van behind the building. She watched as a man drove the van away, but she didn’t know at the time that Heeringa was missing.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Find Jessica Heeringa/Facebook</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The case went cold, and for about three years, authorities had no leads.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On June 29, 2014, young mother Rebekah Bletsch was shot in the head while jogging. That case, too, went cold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But in April 2016, authorities caught a break when a 16-year-old girl was walking home from a party. The girl said a man in a silver van asked her if she needed a ride. When she got into his van to use his phone, the man allegedly began to drive away and pulled a gun on her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The girl jumped out of the moving van and called police to report the alleged attempted kidnapping.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Police pulled surveillance video and allegedly identified Willis’ van. They searched his home and found evidence that tied Willis to the alleged attempted kidnapping as well as to the murders of both Heeringa and Bletsch. (Willis faces trial in the girl’s attempted kidnapping later this year.)</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Joel Bissell/Muskegon Chronicle/AP</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b><i>• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? </i></b><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1><b><i>Click here</i></b></a><b><i> to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter.</i></b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At Willis’ trial for Heeringa’s murder, detectives testified that they found a folder on Willis’ laptop entitled “VICS.” The folder included information related to both murders.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Willis’ arrest, a court official told PEOPLE that investigators recovered bondage equipment from his van, including handcuffs, rope, chain, a bail gag and leather restraints. They also allegedly found lubricant and sex toys along with a handgun, syringes, insulin, gloves and Viagra.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The recovered gun became a significant part of the case against Willis for Heeringa’s murder. During the trial, Muskegon County Prosecutor D.J. Hilson told jurors that the firearm in the van was linked to the kidnapping and the two murders.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Facebook</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Willis initially faced trial for the murder of Bletsch. He was convicted last November and sentenced to life in prison. He wept while the sentence was handed down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During his murder trial in Heeringa’s death, Hilson, the prosecutor, contended that Willis abducted the woman from the gas station at approximately 11 p.m. Then, Hilson said, Willis brought Heeringa to his grandfather’s house where he sexually assaulted her before shooting her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It was a torture sanctuary where he could make his own videos,” Hilson said during closing statements, pointing out that thousands of torture videos were found on Willis’ computer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Willis had pleaded not guilty to the charges. His defense attorney, Fred Johnson, suggested that the van seen behind the gas station actually belonged to someone who was buying drugs from Heeringa. Heeringa’s boyfriend had testified that she had used heroin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the end, the jury sided with the prosecution and found Willis guilty. He was escorted out of the courtroom. He will be sentenced later this month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An attorney for Willis did not immediately return PEOPLE’s call for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Ontq6xjqOcrKuZmK5utMSeqaKml5Z6rsHRnZyrZZqas6e%2BxLJksKGcoba0ecKopa%2Bhk6mypXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ayesha-siddiqa.html><span>←</span><span>Ayesha Siddiqa</span></a>
