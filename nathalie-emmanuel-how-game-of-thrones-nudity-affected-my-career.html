Why was that normal?'” the Dutch actress, 44, recalled at the time. “I did question things and it was not so much that I was blaming anyone, but that’s just how we evolved, and just how the movement affected me. … [I was] very aware of the male gaze.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Emilia Clarke</strong></a>, who played Daenerys Targaryen, revealed that <a href=#>she was tired of doing nude scenes</a> after Game of Thrones — which is why she turned down the lead role in Fifty Shades of Grey.</p><p>“The last time that I was naked on camera on [Game of Thrones] was a long time ago, and yet it is the only question that I ever get asked because I am a woman,” Clarke, 34, told The Hollywood Reporter in 2019. “And it’s annoying as hell and<a href=#> I’m sick and tired of it because I did it for the character</a> — I didn’t do it so some guy could check out my tits, for God’s sake.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKWarJiWuaqxjJ6kppmeqrKteceormafkaKybrvFZquhqp%2BjsrR5za6boqypYq6nssScq56cXaLGbq%2FAq5yeql8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marina-bondarko.html><span>←</span><span>Marina Bondarko- Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Net Worth</span></a>
