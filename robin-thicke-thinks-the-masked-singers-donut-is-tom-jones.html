The hint did, however, strengthen his hypothesis that Donut is<strong> Tom Jones</strong>.</p><p>“My dad knew everybody,” Robin says of Alan, who died at age 69 in 2016. “But if Donut is who I think it is, I’m a lifelong fan of your voice and your vibrato. And my dad had mentioned to me before he passed [that] you and him had become friendly.”</p><p>Robin also notes the connection to a previous Donut clue package where the performer revealed that he lost the love of his life. “All that connects to one person in my heart and mind, and that would be Tom Jones, the legendary singer,” Robin explains. (Jones’ wife, Linda Trenchard, died of lung cancer in 2016 at age 76.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Robin-Thicke-Thinks-The-Masked-Singer-s-Donut-Could-Be-His-Late-Dad-s-Pal.jpg><p><strong>Jenny McCarthy</strong> thinks Robin could be onto something with his Jones guess because Donut “feels like a legend,” but she decided to run with clues that hinted at an association with a 1980s TV show.</p><p>“Bo Duke … from The Dukes of Hazzard,” McCarthy, 51, tells her fellow panelists. “It could be <strong>John Schneider</strong> possibly. He knows how to sing. … Ken likes [that guess], which is scary.”</p><p>In addition to Jones, 83, and Schneider, 63, the panelists have previously guessed that Donut could be <strong>Stanley Tucci</strong>, <strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong>, <strong>Engelbert Humperdinck</strong> and <strong>Liam Neeson</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Robin-Thicke-Thinks-The-Masked-Singer-s-Donut-Could-Be-His-Late-Dad-s-Pal-inline.jpg><p>Donut is one of only six contestants remaining on season 10 of The Masked Singer, which kicked off in September.
