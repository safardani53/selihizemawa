Life can be dark and messy. Nobody has a perfect life.</p><p>"My earliest memories of childhood were of heaviness and chaos. My mom's emotions were so erratic that it was like walking a tightrope every day. The mood fluctuations were daily," the Nickelodeon star added.</p><h2 id=troubled-past>TROUBLED PAST</h2><p>Jennette explained how growing up, she would watch physical fights between her parents, Debbie and Mark.</p><p>When the actress turned six, her mother became obsessed with the notion of turning her into "a star."</p><p>"My mom had always dreamt of being a famous actor and she became obsessed with making me a star."</p><p>Jennette began attending auditions although she felt she was painfully "shy."</p><p>"I felt like my job was to keep the peace. And I wanted to make my mom happy."</p><p>Debbie became increasingly preoccupied with her daughter's appearance, bleaching her hair and whitening her teeth by the time she turned 10.</p><p>When Jennette was 11 her mom began teaching her how to count calories, and when she landed her first big role on iCarly, she had developed "full-fledged anorexia."</p><h2 id=disordered-diet>DISORDERED DIET</h2><p>The singer-songwriter fell victim to multiple eating disorders, developing binge eating, and later bulimia.</p><p>In a bizarre confession, the blonde told the outlet that "Debbie insisted on performing vaginal and breast exams and never let her shower alone."</p><p>"I know if my mom were alive, I'd still have an eating disorder. It was only distance from her that allowed me to get healthy," she explained, adding that she finally got healthy in 2018 after "intense" therapy.</p><h2 id=fresh-start>FRESH START</h2><p>After Debbie passed in 2013,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jennette left acting behind</a>&nbsp;and was finally able to rebel, as she felt she had been "repressed and delayed developmentally" throughout her childhood.</p><p>However, her rebellion turned into years of bulimia and eventually an alcohol dependency, which she only recently confronted as a bi-product of her harmful home life.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"It's a risk to change your life, but I made it my mission," she claimed, as she abandoned her acting career and pivoted into writing and directing.</p><p>"I did not know how to find my identity without my mom. And I'm not going to lie. It was very hard to get here. But now, I'm at a place in my life that I never would have thought was possible.
