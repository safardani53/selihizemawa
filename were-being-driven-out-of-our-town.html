I grew up around here, sometimes I feel I’m being pushed out."</p><p>While Mr Reid is considering moving out, estate agent Jack Richards is planning to move in.</p><p>The 34-year-old said he is attracted by the wealth of restaurants, café’s, a new wine shop, and the views.</p><p>The estate agent, who lives in Addiscombe, said: “You’ve just got so much to do, there’s so many different shops within 3, 4, 500 metres.</p><p>“I can see how it’s kind of become gentrified over last few, maybe two, years, there’s a lot of young families moving in.</p><p>“It was named number one place to live in London and I think people have got a bit of a whiff.</p><p>“Because of the niche shops around here, it doesn’t have that high street feel – there’s not a Greggs or a Nando’s – it sets it apart.”</p><p>Burger van owner Vaidas Tukanas praised the community in the area, saying “this is the place you want to be".</p><p>When his stationary Roti Bros restaurant caught fire he claims he had numerous residents offer to donate money.</p><p>The Lithuanian cook, who lives in <a href=#>Romford</a> and has run the van for 10 years, said: “It’s one of the greatest communities I have seen, and I have lived and I have travelled lots.</p><p>“I don’t live in this area but wherever I’ve lived is completely different."</p><p>The business owner praised the fight against the 24-hour McDonald’s, adding: “So you can see as well that it is a strong community, I think this is how the locals should act, this is how you should look after your place that you live in.</p><p>“It’s changing definitely, maybe I’m going to be a little negative on this side, because the prices are going up – a lot of customers are saying even maybe I can’t afford [to live here] anymore. They’re relocating.”</p><p>Pensioner Joe Burke, 77, likes Crystal Palace and has lived there for four years having moved from West Norwood.</p><p>He said: “There is a lot of young people. There seems to be lots of people.</p><p>“All the pubs have been turned to gastropubs now really, which I don’t mind because the food is always good.</p><p>“The restaurants around here are really good. There have been some craft breweries open up, there are quite a few pubs but they’re gastropubs.”</p><p>Anna Gibbs, 42, is a new mum and runs a shop in east London.</p><p>She has lived in Crystal Palace for just six months having moved from Dalston, north-east London and says the quality doesn’t quite match the prices.</p><p>She said: “There is a lot more young mums here than there is in Dalston, and young people and people who are being priced out [of other areas] coming here.</p><p>“It’s £3.10 for coffee, but it’s the same as east London – maybe the quality is better in east because there’s more competition, so you’re paying £3.10 for maybe an okay coffee.”</p><p>A butcher-turned-restaurant PR worker said she worries there are not enough residents to keep business flowing into shops, and as a result they’re shutting down shortly after opening.</p><p>Jess Ragg, 31, said: “I’ve lived here for four years and even since I’ve lived here it’s got much more expensive.</p><p>“The rent’s got more expensive. Just the area, it’s changed in the last four years.</p><p>“The shops are always closing down, lots of boutiques open on my and shut down, shops are changing all the time because the rent’s too high.</p><p>“But there is a massive difference between how many people are here and how many shops there are, there is not enough people to sustain them.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“The fishmonger opened up and there was a massive buzz, but every time I go past there it’s empty.</p><p>“I work in restaurants, and even though it seems to be hip and cool there’s still no big openings.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/vidas-tukanas-aged-46-originally-846726352.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gv-high-street-crystal-palace-846726580.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wayne-reid-aged-55-dog-846726178.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4FxhY9pZ2pnp5q%2FpnnBnqCnn12Zv6rCxKdkqK2kYrynec6uqWasn6y7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lily-rose-johnston.html><span>←</span><span>Lily Rose Johnston</span></a>
