There are, however, several No-Fly Zones that prevent you from climbing on top of your trusty broom. These are indicated on your HUD via a tiny icon at the bottom left corner of your screen, showing a bird with a red cross through it. If this is on your screen, you simply won’t be able to fly in that location.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Once you’ve verified you’re outside of a No-Fly Zone, you can equip your broom by pressing whichever key you’ve assigned it to – this defaults to L1, LB, and Tab+3 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, respectively. Flying is similar to walking, with the exception that you’ll now have a way to quickly climb towards the sky or rapidly descend towards the ground.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to dive on your broom in 'Hogwarts Legacy'.</h2><p>If you’re looking to quickly get back on your feet – but you happen to be soaring up in the clouds – you’ll want to perfect the dive maneuver in Hogwarts Legacy. This can be done by simply pointing your character toward the ground and activating your broom’s speed boost (assigned to L2, LT, or Left Mouse). This will send you plummeting back down to earth at a breakneck pace.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to get a broom in 'Hogwarts Legacy'.</h2><p>While broomsticks are an integral part of Hogwarts Legacy, you won’t be able to ride one until completing the Jackdaw’s Rest quest. After this mission, you’ll be able to participate in a Flying Class on the grounds outside Hogwarts. Complete your Flying Class, and you’ll be able to purchase a broom from Spintwitches Sporting Needs in Hogsmeade.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>If you were bold enough to check in at this location prior to finishing your Flying Class, you’ll note that the store was perpetually closed – but it magically opens once you’ve completed your Flying Class.</p><p>It's here at Spintwitches that you’ll be able to buy a broom in Hogwarts Legacy. They cost a pretty penny, so consider hunting down some <a href=#>Eye Chests</a> and earning a bit of coin before heading out on a shopping spree.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Looking to upgrade your broom? Venture over to the Quidditch Pitch and chat with Iselda. Here, you can jump into time trials that offer various upgrades to your broomstick and flying prowess.</p><p><strong>J.K.
