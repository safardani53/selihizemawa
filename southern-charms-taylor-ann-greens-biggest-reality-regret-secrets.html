In fact, it has to do with her season 9 fight with Austen’s BFF <a href=#><strong>Craig Conover</strong></a>.</p><p>“Blowing up at Craig and saying hurtful things [is my regret],” Taylor confessed to Us, referring to her claim during the season premiere that Craig’s girlfriend, <a href=#><strong>Paige DeSorbo</strong></a>, <a href=#>“cheated” on him</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Southern-Charm-s-Taylor-Ann-Green-Reveals-Biggest-Reality-Regret-%E2%80%94-And-No-It-s-Not-About-Austen-Kroll-779.jpg><p>At the time, Craig, 34, laughed off the allegation and <a href=#>later told Us that he knew there was no truth to the rumor</a>. “Paige is like, ‘How on earth would I have pulled that off?’” Craig exclusively recalled to Us in September, pointing out that neither he nor Paige, 30, can be “secretive” as reality stars.</p><p>Looking back, Taylor told Us that although she “tries to give [herself] a drink limit” while filming, that rule went out the window during <a href=#><strong>Madison LeCroy</strong></a>’s post-wedding celebration, which is when she lashed out at Craig. (The party was the first time Taylor had seen her ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Shep Rose</strong></a> in months, which caused even more tension.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Southern-Charm-s-Taylor-Ann-Green-Reveals-Biggest-Reality-Regret-%E2%80%94-And-No-It-s-Not-About-Austen-Kroll-781.jpg><p>Taylor admitted that she “100 percent” had too much to drink at that event. “I was very nervous going into that party, seeing Shep and all that stuff, so I should have really been on my best behavior,” she added.</p><p>Throughout season 9, <a href=#>Taylor’s actions have raised eyebrows</a>. In addition to <a href=#>feuding with Craig</a>, she sparked romance rumors with Austen, 36.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Southern-Charm-s-Taylor-Ann-Green-Reveals-Biggest-Reality-Regret-%E2%80%94-And-No-It-s-Not-About-Austen-Kroll-780.jpg><p>While Austen and Taylor initially denied they’d ever hooked up, they eventually admitted to kissing in late 2022 while Austen was trying to work things out with Taylor’s BFF <a href=#><strong>Olivia Flowers</strong></a>. (The drama played out during <a href=#>an October episode of the Bravo series</a>.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite being at the center of most of the season 9 blowouts, Taylor told Us that it’s “probably Austen” and Madison, 33, who “cause the most drama” among the cast. “Madison likes to stir the pot. She likes to throw a bomb in there and see what happens,” she teased.</p><p>Watch Us Weekly’s exclusive video above for more of Taylor’s reality show secrets — including whether there were any “secret romances” off-camera this season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqoraSdsrO6jJyfmqqdqHq1rdilpqtlkaO7brPRnpynq12XtqizxKyrZqqVlrmqwNhmqZ6foprBbr%2FEnKmerKNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shinya.html><span>←</span><span>Shinya</span></a>
