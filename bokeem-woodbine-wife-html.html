But, despite all this, his wife stayed by his side. Not only did she provide him company, but she also offered him enough support and motivation to deal with the slump.</span></p><p><span>Woodbine himself affirmed&nbsp;that her support was the factor that helped him secure a spot in&nbsp;Hollywood yet again.</span></p><h2><span>Bokeem Woodbine's Slump Started From 2001</span></h2><p><span>Woodbine&nbsp;got into acting at the age of 19. At first, the 47-year-old&nbsp;starred in Strapped&nbsp;(1993) and worked as an extra in Juice (1992).&nbsp;Woodbine also starred in&nbsp;the great black classics of the 90s like&nbsp;Crooklyn&nbsp;(1994), Dead Presidents,&nbsp;and Panther (1995), to name a few.</span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span>However, his smooth-running career took a rather nasty&nbsp;turn from 2001.&nbsp;Though Woodbine&nbsp;got his hands on acclaimed movies such as Devil (2010), Riddick (2013), and&nbsp;The Host&nbsp;(2013),&nbsp;they&nbsp;added no value to his personal growth.&nbsp;Let's just say, Woodbine's&nbsp;acting stints weren't translated into anticipated personal satisfaction&nbsp;though they paid the bills.</span></p><p><span>The situation lasted 15 long years before&nbsp;he finally landed his breakthrough role as Mike Milligan&nbsp;in the hit 2014 crime series&nbsp;Fargo.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2><span>Bokeem Woodbine's Stints In 'Fargo' Revitalized Career</span></h2><p><span>In 2014, Woodbine got the call to audition for Fargo. Since the movie&nbsp;typically focused&nbsp;on the mid-western environment, he&nbsp;thought&nbsp;the call was a mistake. Little did he know!&nbsp;It was an opportunity that rejuvenated&nbsp;his stagnant career.&nbsp;</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span>A year in the series and his once lost popularity started to rise. So much so,&nbsp;the actor even classifies&nbsp;his acting experience as "everything before Fargo" and "everything after Fargo" while talking to </span><a href=# rel="follow noopener"><span>Variety</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span>The crime series certainly brought Woodbine's&nbsp;popularity back in Hollywood with contracts to numerous new projects. After getting that part, the actor got into new movies and series such as <a href=# rel=follow>Spider-Man: Homecoming</a> (2017), The Infamous (2016), and&nbsp;Snowfall (2017).</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p><span>More recently, he was </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>assigned</span></a><span> Unsolved- The Murders of Tupac and The Notorious B.I.G. in 2018. Furthermore, he is also a part of the much-anticipated&nbsp;2021 series Halo&nbsp;and the film&nbsp;Ghostbusters: Afterlife.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span>Bokeem Woodbine's&nbsp;Wife&nbsp;Mahiely Woodbine Motivated Him To Never Give Up</span></h2><p><span>Self-doubts and stress were Woodbine's&nbsp;constant companions&nbsp;during the decade-long slump. Thankfully,&nbsp;there was that one person in his life who was above all these issues — his wife,&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>Mahiely Woodbine</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Even though Mahiely&nbsp;didn't understand the industry, she believed in Woodbine. So, when the&nbsp;Fargo&nbsp;star doubted his potentials and career choice, she showed him the other way around. She&nbsp;encouraged him and pushed him to believe in himself.</span></p><p><span>Many might not know this, but Mahiely&nbsp;was the one who </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>motivated</span></a><span> Woodbine to be on Fargo.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span>When he got the audition call, she went to her sister's house to let Bokkem concentrate on the audition's preparation.</span></p><p><span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span><strong>Bokeem Woodbine attends the Los Angeles Premiere of 'Total Recall' with wife&nbsp;Mahiely Woodbine in 2012&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span>Reciprocating </span>the support,&nbsp;<span>Woodbine</span> is vocal about his wife's dedication to his life. When <span>talking</span>&nbsp;to the host of the YouTube channel&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>HOT 97</span></a><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>in 2018, he stated that his wife supported him in bleak&nbsp;<span>times</span>. He even shed light on the most challenging time of his slump. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span>To be in a weak position is very hard for me, to be weak, financially weak. My mind was weak. I was so frustrated. I couldn't understand.&nbsp;I couldn't get a job. They weren't hiring, brother!</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span>Then, Woodbine revealed that he had no motivation to keep going. He only continued because his wife, Mahiely, assured him that&nbsp;he would reach his destination if he didn't give up.</span></p><p><span>I couldn't get no traction. You can get nowhere. And my woman, at the the bleakest of time... I was at zero. I had no chi. I couldn't find the motivation to keep going. And, it was my woman who said 'one day they are going to find who you are!'</span></p><p><span>With the support of his wife, Woodbine, slowly but surely, is rising to carve out a new era in his career.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e8rLHEpmSwp5%2BZr6q6xGauop6VY7W1ucs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maggie-qs-husband-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Maggie Q Dating Maggie Q's Husband &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
