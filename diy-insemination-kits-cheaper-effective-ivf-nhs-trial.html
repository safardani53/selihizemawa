Priced at £700, the kits are 20 times cheaper than in vitro fertilisation and open the doors to more couples hoping to start a family.
The NHS currently only funds IVF and intrauterine insemination (IUI) for couples who are struggling to conceive.
IVF involves fertilising an egg in a laboratory before inserting it into the woman’s womb to grow, while IUI involves inserting sperm directing into a woman’s womb."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
