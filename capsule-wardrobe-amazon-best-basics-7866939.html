Then you replenish the racks with fewer, very intentional items that are meant to last and work well with everything else you own. What that looks like in practice: Simple pieces in classic, flattering silhouettes that aren't likely to go out of style anytime soon, and picking neutral colors that can be mixed and matched into different outfits easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're thinking about starting your own capsule wardrobe — or even if you just need some good basics and want to start in the easiest possible place — we rounded up our favorite finds on Amazon, backed by tons of positive reviews (and in some cases, celebrity fans). Buy one piece or stock up on them all; at $70 and under for every item, this is a no regret, versatile investment you'll be happy you made.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-white-tee></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The White Tee</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The quest for the perfect white T-shirt can feel almost Herculean at times. Does one exist that's lightweight but not transparent, fitted but flattering, and doesn't cost a fortune? According to hundreds of Amazon reviewers, this Madewell tee might check all the boxes. For under $20, this delivers softness, comfort and quality that many reviewers claim holds up after washing.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Best white tee on Amazon.</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-black-blazer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Black Blazer</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Initially an office staple, blazers are having a fashion moment, whether worn with crop tops and jeans, as part of an oversized suit set or just adding a little polish to a comfortable travel outfit. We (and hundreds of other shoppers) like this slightly roomy cut for being able to do all that and more, at a great price.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Best black blazer on Amazon.</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-classic-jeans></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Classic Jeans</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Top models including Bella Hadid and Hailey Bieber love Levi's "wedgie" jeans for their surprisingly flattering fit (despite the name) and they've caught on with tons more people since being popularized in paparazzi shots. Reviewers love them for their butt-flattering cut and for holding their shape after many wears.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Best jeans on Amazon.</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-gold-hoops></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Gold Hoops</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">More than 45,000 Amazon shoppers have reviewed these hoops and left them with a glowing 4.5-star rating — and at prices as low as $13.95 (for 20MM gold-plated) or $36.95 (for vermeil) you can nab the versatile, well-loved earrings that come in four sizes and earn wearers "countless compliments" without breaking the bank.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Best gold hoops on Amazon.</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-white-sneakers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The White Sneakers</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Everyone has a favorite pair of white sneakers, so you might as well pick one that's royally approved: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the Superga sneakers favored by Kate Middleton</a>. She's often seen pairing them her sportier looks, and even people without access to a tiara collection call them "objectively awesome," with high marks for comfort and wearability.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Best white sneakers on Amazon.</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-striped-sweater></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Striped Sweater</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cupshe's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>swimsuits</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>casual dresses </a>are staples in the closet of many a Bachelor Nation member, and people are equally as enthusiastic about their fall offerings, including this sweet slouchy striped number. "99.99% of the time Cupshe is on point. This is no exception," one reviewer wrote of the lightweight, layer-able piece with dropped shoulders that add some visual interest.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Best striped sweater on Amazon.</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-black-leggings></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Black Leggings</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spanx have mastered the mix of cute (the compression fabric that flatters everyone) and comfortable (they're black leggings — need we say more)? Celebs including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Garner and Jenna Dewan have been seen in Spanx's athleisure</a>, and you'll join the chorus of happy reviewers who like the opaque fabric that can be "dressed up or down." (One note: We wouldn't work out in this pair — it's strictly for your capsule wardrobe only.)</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Best black leggings on Amazon.</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-perfect-sunglasses></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Perfect Sunglasses</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While there is no one style of sunglasses that works on every face, this style is pretty darn close: A rounded frame with a slight cat-eye, in a dark tortoise that looks good with most skin tones and hair colors. More than 1,600 Amazon reviewers have given these a 4.5-star rating for being durable, lightweight and a great price.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Best sunglasses on Amazon.</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-nude-flats></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Nude Flats</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ballet flats are back in for fall (were they ever really out?) and stylists and celebs alike love a "nude" version for the way it visually lengthens your leg (and goes with pretty much everything). Since no two nudes are alike, we like these under-$20 pairs that come in multiple shades and styles — and so do more than 1,000 reviewers who have given them high marks.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Best nude flats on Amazon.</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-claw-clip></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Claw Clip</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another accessory that gives trendy '90s vibes and yet is totally timeless: The humble claw clip, which can polish up an outfit or simply keep your hair out of your face while hunkered down at home. So many celebs love Kitsch, and we're guessing some of them might be among the 400 reviewers raving about this two-pack (made of recycled plastic!) for its powers over long, thick and curly hair. "This clip captures it all!" one wrote.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Best claw clip on Amazon.</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-cropped-jacket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Cropped Jacket</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For days when you want to brave the elements without looking like a snowman yourself, this cute cropped parka does it all (and is Amazon climate-pledge friendly, and comes in sizes up to 6X, and is under $80). Reviewers praise it for being lightweight and superwarm.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Best puffer jacket on Amazon.</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-up-next-36-yes-36-adorable-stylist-approved-fall-dresses-to-buy-now></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5OWvbTBy55ksJmimb%2BwrsRmmKaZqqS7bq7ErKtmmpGotqS%2FjHBvb25paIY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kari-pearce.html><span>←</span><span>Kari Pearce</span></a>
