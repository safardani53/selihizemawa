Him texting his ex makes him look bad. But him outing her/making her look bad is where she draws the line! How dare he show her slip’n!"</p><p>Someone also commented: "Ding ding ding. She prob pretended to not too bothered yesterday when it was about David dreaming of her, but him showing the clothes on the floor calling her a pig to the ex prob pushed her over the edge."</p><p>Another said: "She’s mad about the texts."</p><h2>SNEAKY TEXTS</h2><p>David was caught <a href=#>sending messages</a> to his ex Whitney Johnson earlier this month.</p><p>Verified text messages sent from&nbsp;David's cell phone to Whitney on May 5, 2022, also show the former&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a>&nbsp;star ruthlessly slamming his wife&nbsp;Jenelle.</p><p>Whitney is <a href=#>David's ex-wife</a> who he married in 2006. His first child, Maryssa Rose, was born to her in August of 2007.</p><p>The two had a messy divorce which resulted in Eason gaining full custody of daughter Maryssa in 2017.</p><p>Jenelle's husband began the conversations with his ex that afternoon to discuss who was to pick up&nbsp;<a href=#>their daughter Maryssa</a>, 16.&nbsp;</p><p>The discussion, however, quickly veered into territory that his ex Whitney has called "inappropriate."</p><p>David, frustrated with Jenelle, first shared a screen grab of his conversations with his wife, where the&nbsp;Teen Mom&nbsp;star asks David: "Are u going or me to get Kaiser?" to which David replies: "Maryssa doesn't get picked up till 5:30 today."</p><p>After he shared a screen grab of his exchange with Jenelle with his ex-wife, he told her: "Now this, I can never win."</p><p>"She's mad because I have two loads worth of laundry. She has the entire room covered with her clothes," he wrote to Whitney and then shared a photo from inside the bedroom he shares with Jenelle in their home in North Carolina.&nbsp;</p><p>The photo shows Jenelle and David's bedroom with clothes nearly covering the entire floor as well as piled on their bed.</p><p>There is also trash littered about and debris scattered atop their dresser.&nbsp;</p><p>"Literally, this is all her s**t. Not one article of this clothing is mine but I'm a POS for cleaning.</p><p>"Sorry, I just need someone to vent to I have no friends except JD and he runs his mouth when he gets drunk. As if cleaning my own mess is worse than cheating. LMAO," David continued to rant.</p><p>Whitney then pivots the conversation back to the issue of who is going to pick up their daughter, as was his reasoning for reaching out in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking exclusively to The U.S. Sun, Whitney called the exchange "inappropriate," while her husband Shane Rich revealed he was sitting next to her throughout the day as the texts took place.</p><p>Whitney said: "A bedroom is a couple's private space, that's their bedroom, their intimate place - it was crazy that he would send me photos of it."</p><p>Shane said: "I was sitting right next to her. She was showing me the texts like, 'Can you believe this?' and I was telling her to keep responding to see where David was going with all of this."</p><h2>CAN'T ESCAPE THE PAST?</h2><p>In other texts from that day, which were revealed earlier this week,&nbsp;<a href=#>David told his ex he dreams about her all the time</a>.</p><p>In those exchanges, which took place later that evening, David said to Whitney: "You were perfect. You just deserve so much better than everything you've been through. That's why it makes me so sad. I think about it so much.</p><p>"And I dream about you all the time. I don't know how I ended up here instead of where I wanted to be. I don't know how WE ended up here instead of where I wanted US to be."</p><p>David then added: "I'm just so upset right now. And I wish I could turn back the clock."</p><p>Whitney, 35, said that outside of this exchange, she and David "had hardly communicated at all because Maryssa had a phone since she was eight years old."</p><p>"So all my communication was through her other than maybe a handful of times," she added.</p><p>"It was very surprising not to mention the fact that he was married, still married. I was married, still married.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"It was inappropriate and very unexpected."</p><p>In the texts, David suggested&nbsp;<a href=#>he and Jenelle had been fighting</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/teen-mom-jenelle-evans-slammed-647201675.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/teen-mom-jenelle-evans-breaks-849703950-9.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/whitney-rich-husband-shane-teen-854602923-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZGp9dYCUaKuenZ5iurC5jKOcp52cobJusdWapaxllJbDqrCMnpisp55isrl51qKdnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mums-slam-store-selling-spectacle-wearing-dolls-four-eyes.html><span>←</span><span>Mums slam store for selling spectacle-wearing dolls named 'four eyes'</span></a>
