Pete has some special surprises in store for her birthday and for Christmas,” a source exclusively tells Us Weekly. “He truly cares about her and wants to show her how much she means to him.”</p><p>Us confirmed in September that Davidson, 30, and Cline, who turned 26 on Thursday, December 21, had <a href=#>started dating</a>.</p><p>The new romance came one month after Davidson’s split from <strong>Chase Sui Wonders</strong>, whom he was first linked to in January. A source told Us at the time that there was “<a href=#>no bad blood</a> or any hard feelings” between the Bodies Bodies Bodies costars, and their “relationship had simply run its course.”</p><p>As for Davidson’s dynamic with Cline, the comedian’s family members see a difference compared to his past relationships.</p><p>“Pete’s mom and sister completely support this relationship. His sister, Casey, adores Madelyn and is closer to her than she’s been to some of his other exes he’s dated in the past,” the first source shares. “They appreciate that she doesn’t feel the need to put their relationship on full display for the world. It makes them feel like the feelings they have for each other are genuine, which they really respect.”</p><p>While the pair have kept a relatively low profile thus far, they were <a href=#>spotted hanging out</a> in New York City in October right after Davidson’s Saturday Night Live hosting debut.</p><p>Some of Davidson’s past relationships were far more public. <strong>Ariana Grande</strong> cowrote a song named after the King of Staten Island star during their whirlwind romance. The track was released in August 2018, the same month that Grande, 30, thanked Davidson for “existing” during her acceptance speech for Best Pop Video at the MTV Video Music Awards. Davidson and Grande <a href=#>called off their engagement</a> that October.</p><p>The actor’s other past flames include <strong>Cazzie David</strong>, <strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong>, <strong>Margaret Qualley</strong>, <strong>Phoebe Dynevor</strong>, <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> and <strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cline, for her part, split from <strong>Chase Stokes</strong> in November 2021 after more than one year of dating. The exes <a href=#>remain costars</a> on Outer Banks.</p><p>“We always said that the job remains untouched. Nothing else, personal or negative, will touch the job,” Cline told Cosmopolitan in February of working with Stokes, 31, post-split. “And while that’s not always easy, our job is to leave the show better than we found it, to leave the season better than we found it. And I’m really appreciative of that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapnaSaeqWt1aKbrKeeYrWiv4ysrKuoop7Apr%2BMqaOapp6asW6yzqtkppmUmrm6uoyco6Kmlah6o7XRrZ%2Bdmalk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./world-book-day-best-fancy-dress-costumes.html><span>←</span><span>Last minute World Book Day 2018 costume ideas and where to buy them - from Belle to the Gruffalo</span></a>
