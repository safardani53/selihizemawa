You can’t have it both ways.”</p><p>The actress continued, “In Hollywood, who you’re dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act. For me, it’s the difference between being able to have a life and not. If someone takes a photograph of me and posts it, within two seconds they’ve created a marker of exactly where I am within 10 meters. They can see what I’m wearing and who I’m with; I just can’t give that tracking data.”</p><p>Two years later, however, Harry Potter’s <a href=#><strong>Rupert Grint</strong> </a>hinted that things between Watson and Felton might have been <a href=#>a little more than platonic</a>. “There was always something,” Grint, who played Ron Weasley in all eight movies, told Entertainment Tonight in November 2019. “There was a little bit of a spark. … We were kids. It was like any kind of playground romance … I didn’t have any sparks. I was spark-free.”</p><p>The Brown University graduate has been linked to celebrities including <a href=#><strong>Chord Overstreet</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a> throughout her career, which skyrocketed in 2001 thanks to her role as Hermione Granger in the movie adaptation of <a href=#><strong>J.K. Rowling</strong></a>’s beloved book series. But in her December 2019 British Vogue cover story, Watson opened up about her most important relationship: <a href=#>the one she has with herself</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“If you have not built a home, if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby, and you are turning 30, and you’re not in some incredibly secure, stable place in your career … There’s just an incredible amount of anxiety,” she told the outlet. “I never believed the whole ‘I’m happy single’ spiel. It took me a long time, but I’m very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see everyone Watson has romanced — or has been rumored to have romanced — in the past!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksq65wGaumqyjpLu0ecOaq6Kml2K1qr%2FTqKmyZaCntq%2BvxGafmqqirnqktM6rm2anppq%2FtMDRnpytZZ2kv6Z7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karrueche-tran-butt-pic-chris-brown-teasing.html><span>←</span><span>Cute Photo Hollywood Life</span></a>
