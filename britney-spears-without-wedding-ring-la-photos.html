Her nails were painted red and she appeared relaxed despite the lack of jewelry that’s sparked rumors she and Sam may be having marital struggles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/britney-spears-no-ring-backgrid-2embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Britney’s latest outing comes just one day after Sam was seen walking with his wedding ring on, which is different from last week, when both he and Britney were first <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen not wearing</a> their rings. Divorce rumors quickly started among online followers, and the hunky spouse seemed to laugh them off when he shared a selfie to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> story that showed him rocking the ring while working out and again on a plane. His representative also confirmed that he and Britney were still happily married and even gave a reason why he took the ring off.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Sam is not having marital issues,” rep <strong>Brandon Cohen</strong>&nbsp;told<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight</a>. “He simply took off his ring because he is filming a movie.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Speculation about Britney and Sam’s marriage comes 10 months after they tied the knot. Their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding</a> took place just one month after the “Sometimes” crooner was freed from her conservatorship and included many celebrity guests, including<strong> Selena Gomez</strong>, <strong>Paris Hilton</strong>, and <strong>Drew Barrymore</strong>. Sam first spoke about wearing his wedding ring, in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GMA</a> shortly after their nuptials. “I have to wear this thing now!” he said while showing it off to the cameras. “It’s heavy, so I’m getting a workout with it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH11e49xZpuqmam7psWMrKeemaKoeri106GmrqxdrLKlsMinnmaqmaO0brjAZqehp6SkwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tricia-davis-19840129-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tricia Davis (Talent Manager) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
