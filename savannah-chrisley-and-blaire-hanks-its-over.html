"It does because for me he was that definition of just my first true love and I’m trying to stay strong y’all."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Those who <a href=#>watch Chrisley Knows Best online</a> have witnessed the couple’s romantic journey over the course of a few seasons.</p><p>While Savannah freely admits things weren’t always perfect, she only had positive things to say about the memories she created with Hanks.</p><p>And, even with her soul feeling crushed, she didn’t insult her ex in any way on Facebook.</p><p>"I hope that you will please do me a favor and don’t send negative vibes to him," she even asked of her supporters, adding:</p><p>"He doesn’t deserve that. We are young. We had our young love. It wasn’t my fault. It wasn’t his fault. There were faults on both sides."</p><p>What an impressive and mature way to look at things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Chrisley likely does have a new perspective on things these days.</p><p>She nearly died in this month’s car crash.</p><p>In response, Savannah posted a photo montage on Instagram that included a picture of herself in the hospital… along with a photo of her destroyed vehicle and a quote that read as follows:</p><p>"The only way God can show us He’s in control is to put us in situation we can’t control."</p><p>She then wrote:</p><p>"I can truly say that I now FULLY understand the meaning of this quote.</p><p>"The past couple of days have been some of the toughest days for me. And I truly think that God has made them so difficult because I began straying away from Him and His word."</p><p>Following such a frightening experience, it makes sense that Savannah would be able to process her break-up as well as she has.</p><p>At least she’s alive to be dumped, right?</p><p>Savannah said she remembers "going in and out of consciousness screaming for help" while cars sped by and she lay on the street, only for a <a href=#>stranger to come to her aid</a>.</p><p>"It felt like I had been laying there for at least twenty minutes begging for help," she wrote.</p><p>"And then a man stopped and ran over to me and got the police my way…so thank you to the amazing man that stopped and helped me as everyone else was passing.</p><p>"I have no idea who you are but thank you…I could never repay you for your act of kindness."</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2V%2BcL%2FAr5inppGdeqS00aKqpZ2pYq6vsIybo5qhopp6qa3NpKpmoaSoerDCxKtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./machine-gun-kelly-denies-punching-a-fan-at-louisville-concert.html><span>←</span><span>Machine Gun Kelly Denies Punching a Fan at Louisville Concert</span></a>
