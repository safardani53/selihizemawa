Her father (my uncle Mick) sadly passed away at the end of April this year. He was an absolute legend, patient, kind and loved by so many. It was so sad that he couldn’t be there to walk his daughter down the aisle on her big day.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the clip, Meakin gave her cousin a classic French ombré manicure, then applied the ashes to a wet acrylic base and added small flecks of silver glitter to Walton’s long stiletto-shaped middle finger nail.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She recently lost her dad…my uncle Mick,” Meakin, who titled the tutorial “The Memory Nails,” says in the voiceover. “We wanted to do something really special so I had the idea the idea of using my uncle’s ashes inside the nails.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kirsty Meakin/ Youtube</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kirsty Meakin/ Youtube</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kirsty Meakin/ Youtube</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kirsty Meakin/ Youtube</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I really don’t think they look too dissimilar to something that you would put into nails,” she adds. “We were quite fascinated actually because, under closer inspection, you could actually see those tiny bits of bone fragment.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meakin says she was impressed by how well the nail with bits of ashes turned out, so she decided to incorporate them into a decorative nail globe (which she applied to Walton’s ring finger) as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The final look is a French ombré with gemstones and glitter applied to each nail in a variety of patterns and designs — “A little bling and there you have it,” Meakin says in the voiceover.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This was an emotional day for us both and we are so please with how they turned out,” she wrote in the description box. “I’m going to remove the nails for Charlotte after they have grown out for around 4 weeks so they will be preserved and kept in a keep sake box as a beautiful memory of the day. What better way to have used a tiny amount of ashes to bring such happiness.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjp6loKSZqLVurtGim55llJqwsL7ArZysZZiav27DxJ2boqaXYruitcusZLChpJ16ra3TnmSfmaSdsrO%2FjJqqoZ2jZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./duggar-divorce-drama-amy-duggars-parents-call-it-quits.html><span>←</span><span>Amy Duggar's Parents Call It Quits!</span></a>
