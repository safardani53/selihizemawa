Drè had a few days off in between his tour dates, so he flew in to take me out. We ended up missing our restaurant reservations, so we decided to hit up a local late night restaurant for dinner.”</p><p>She went on: “I remember being so excited and nervous at the same time. I mean, I knew we meshed well as friends, but how would we be as lovers? Well, based on the second picture, I guess we ended up meshing very well.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>And in an Instagram caption in September 2020, Askale <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed</a> her decision to join Drè in a <a href=#>blended family</a> — and she praised the two kids he brought to the relationship. “That decision was one of the best things I could’ve done,” she told followers.</p><p>“Since my very first encounter with my bonus babies, Bleu and River, they have been a true blessing to my life. They’ve been such a source of unconditional love and light, and I’m so thankful that God chose me to be a receiver of all that they have to offer. I truly can’t express how blessed I feel to have them in my life. … My parents, brother, cousins, we’re all just one big, happy, blended family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsCsrcueZJ2Zpp7AbrTUrJmappQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bellator-mma.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Bellator MMA net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
