The melody of “You Are My Sunshine” played in the background as Longoria smiled for the camera while holding her child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Eva-Longorias-Son-Santiago-Falls-Asleep-on-Her-Says-Shes-Stuck-Underneath-a-Pile-of-Pure-Love-1.jpg><p>The sweet moment was one of many glimpses Longoria gave fans of her life as a mom throughout 2023. In April, the actress celebrated her husband <strong>José “Pepe” Bastón</strong>’s birthday by sharing <a href=#>a rare family photo</a> on social media.</p><p>“Happy birthday to the best dad, family man and husband anyone could ask for! 💗,” Longoria wrote of her spouse, 55.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Eva-Longorias-Son-Santiago-Falls-Asleep-on-Her-Says-Shes-Stuck-Underneath-a-Pile-of-Pure-Love-2.jpg><p>Two months later, Longoria <a href=# rel=noopener>created a video</a> rewind of Santiago’s best moments in 2023 in honor of his birthday. “Another year of happiness, laughter and joy with this little human. I didn’t know this amount of love could exist,” she captioned the Instagram clip. “Happy birthday papa, I love you soooooo much! 💖.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Longoria shared a few of her “2023 unseen moments 😝,” including <a href=# rel=noopener>a video of Santiago</a> on one of her movie sets. In the video, posted on Thursday, Santiago gives Longoria a kiss as she dances and directs a group of actors.</p><p>Since welcoming her only child in <a href=#>June 2018</a>, Longoria has been open about how wonderful Santiago has been for her family. Longoria was already a stepmother to Bastón’s three children, José, Talia and Mariana, whom he shares with his ex-wife, <strong>Natalia Esperón.</strong></p><p>“He’s just funny,” Longoria <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in May 2019 of her baby boy. “He’s very funny, he’s very happy, he loves everybody [and] he goes to everybody. He’s just sweet and kind. He’s just really interested and curious in everybody, so that’s pretty reflective of me because he’s curious.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She explained: “He’s on set with me, [in] meetings with me. I have a photo shoot right after this, [and] he’s with me in the photo shoot.”</p><p>Later that year, the Tell It Like a Woman actress told <a href=#>Parents Latina</a> how Santiago’s birth came at the perfect time. “He was meant to be with me at this stage,” Longoria explained in her August/September 2019 cover story. “I’m more patient, and I don’t work as much even though it doesn’t seem that way!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaerpFiubC6xqipopmjYsCwuoyfmKWko2KutLjEnqdmp55itaa%2BjKmgpZ1dpLNuvNSrnGakn6uycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bear-brown-teams-up-with-multi-billion-brand-but-fans-love-rains-shady-response.html><span>←</span><span> Bear Brown teams up with multi-billion brand but fans love Rains shady response Tue 30</span></a>
