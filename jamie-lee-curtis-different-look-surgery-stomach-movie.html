It's a Magical Mystery Tour of a movie and I'm so excited to see it tomorrow at its premiere opening..."</p><p>The film also stars Crazy Rich Asians' Michelle Yeoh and I Want You Back's <a href=#>Jenny Slate</a>.</p><p>Jamie Lee then got a bit more personal and explained why she decided to go all natural for her role.</p><p>She said: "In the world, there is an industry — a billion-dollar, trillion-dollar industry — about hiding things. Concealers. Body-shapers. Fillers. Procedures. Clothing. Hair accessories. Hair products. Everything to conceal the reality of who we are.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"And my instruction to everybody was: I want there to be no concealing of anything. I've been sucking my stomach in since I was 11, when you start being conscious of boys and bodies, and the jeans are super tight."</p><p>Jamie Lee concluded: "I very specifically decided to relinquish and release every muscle I had that I used to clench to hide the reality. That was my goal. I have never felt more free creatively and physically..."</p><h2 id=all-praise><strong>ALL PRAISE</strong></h2><p>Fans were all about Jamie Lee's admission as they took to the comments section to react with nothing but praise.</p><p>One wrote: "I just love you! You can portray anyone! Best actress!"</p><p>Another added: "As long as I can remember I've always admired you for not looking at them as flaws. They are earned and are beautiful!"</p><p>"Oh my god, I love you!" a third chimed in as another said, "I didn’t even recognize you!"</p><h2 id=you-can-t-get-it-back><strong>'YOU CAN'T GET IT BACK'</strong></h2><p>Jamie Lee being so open about her body should not come as a surprise as she has had no problem touching on the subject of plastic surgery in the past.</p><p>She once told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast Company</a> during an interview: "I tried plastic surgery and it didn’t work. It got me addicted to Vicodin. I’m 22 years sober now."</p><p>The famous star continued: "The current trend of fillers and procedures, and this obsession with filtering, and the things that we do to adjust our appearance on Zoom are wiping out generations of beauty. Once you mess with your face, you can’t get it back.”</p><h2 id=a-real-danger><strong>'A REAL DANGER'</strong></h2><p>She also made it clear the impact social media can have one a person.</p><p>“We just don’t know the longitudinal effect, mentally, spiritually, and physically, on a generation of young people who are in agony because of social media, because of the comparisons to others," she explained.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"All of us who are old enough know that it’s all a lie.
