Plenty of people on the internet are creating and <a href=#>interacting with chatbots</a> as fun little ways to kill time by speaking with an AI. It's a relatively harmless way to distract yourself on the internet.</p><p>But it's proven so popular that there's sometimes a queue to use it.

It was first launched on Sept. 16, 2022. Though it shares many features and concepts with <a href=#>ChatGPT</a>, another AI-generated text bot, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a> recently reported that the app has garnered over 100 million monthly site visits. In fact, the app just raised $150 million in investments.</p><p>With attention and engagement like that, it's no wonder so many people use it. Of course, that kind of traffic also necessitates a waiting room.</p><p>When you first log on to the site, you may be placed in an online waiting room before you can actually start using it. Typically, the waiting period only lasts about a minute, but given that other apps don't normally have this feature, it's certainly noticeable.</p><p>That being said, a waiting room for an app like this is very essential.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Users on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Character.AI subreddit</a> acknowledge that the waiting room is meant to keep the site from getting overloaded by its many users trying to stay on the app. However, the waiting room has caused some issues in the past.</p><p>Some users report that they'll be placed in a waiting room in the middle of chatting, causing confusion among folks who have already been using it at a given moment. Some people even report waiting times of up to 10 minutes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In more recent news, Character.AI servers have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> "bogged" down by a number of <a href=#>TikTok</a> users in order to start chats with villainous characters, which is part of a TikTok trend.</p><p>The increased traffic has apparently resulted in longer waiting periods and response times from chatbots.</p><p>The AI takeover may already have some resistance on certain fronts, but if nothing else, Character.AI is at least a fun little app as long as you can handle some of the unexpected load times.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlk52us63CrZyrZZGeeqmt1Z5kmmWnlra1tc2gZKunn6I%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8fchl5ntobva0igggcoachawza8ooya6.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Madeline Season 1 Episode 6: Madeline in London</span></a>
