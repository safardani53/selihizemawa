The girlfriend of <strong>Scott Disick</strong>, 36, went makeup-free for her session at Hot Pilates and flaunted her enviable abs as she left the studio. Sofia wore a grey crop top with black and grey leggings, a black sweater tied around her waist and Givenchy Paris slides. She slicked her hair back into a messy top knot and wore understated silver jewelry including a thin necklace and bracelet. Sofia clearly understands the importance of staying hydrated, as she carried a large bottle of Fiji water and a bottle of red juice.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The Calabasas socialite was joined by <strong>Kate Moss</strong>‘ 22-year-old half-sister Lottie for the workout sesh, who sported a black hoodie over matching leggings. The fellow model, who boasts 293,000 Instagram followers, took to her Instagram stories to share a sweaty selfie, which she captioned, “‘Only @sofiarichie could make me do a hot Pilates class … Wow okay.” Sofia also shared a mirror selfie on her Instagram story of herself, Lottie, Hot Pilates owner <strong>Shannon Nadj</strong>, and pal <strong>Joey Parris</strong>. She also shared a cute clip of Lottie as the pair walked to the pilates class, with her 6.3 million followers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Sofia has been dating her beau Scott for nearly three years, and despite their 15-year age gap, the pair are as loved-up as ever! The couple were most <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>recently spotted</a> dining at Malibu hot spot Nobu for dinner on Jan. 8, wearing matching black outfits. Scott wearing a black hoodie that read “The World Is Yours Take Care Of It” on the back, fashioning it with a pair of black pants and white sneakers. Sofia, meanwhile, dressed up a bit more than her partner, wearing a pair of black pumps with a high waisted pants, and a black cropped hoodie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sofia-richie-makeup-free-taut-tommy-mega-embved.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>A week earlier, the couple were seen seen spending quality time with Scott’s kids whom he shares with ex&nbsp;<strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong>, 40. <strong>Mason</strong>, 10,&nbsp;<strong>Penelope</strong>, 7, and&nbsp;<strong>Reign</strong>, 5, hit the slopes in Aspen with their dad and his girlfriend — and Sofia was caught twinning again! This time it was little Penelope who looked like her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mini-me</a>. The nine-year-old rocked bright pink ski gear, and Sofia followed suit when they were out on the slopes on Jan 2. The model donned a fuchsia jacket to match Penelope and the two couldn’t have looked better! They were quintessential snow bunnies. We can’t wait to see more from Sofia in 2020!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH1ze49uZqynlp6ubr7InJ%2BinV2irqyx1Klkn6qVmnqirtJmn6isXaW2ra3TnqpmqJikwbB7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./catfish-amazing-smile-real-me-teeth.html><span>←</span><span>I get called a catfish - men chat me up in bars and say I have an amazing smile - then I show them t</span></a>
