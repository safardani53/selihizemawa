The kitchen is separate from the dining room.</p><p>“It doesn’t really work for us, but we don’t know how to make it work for us.”</p><p>Describing the mash up in the home, Paul said: “From a 70s MDF staircase to a 1850s wall that’s now inside.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000506675784.jpg><p>While the house may be Victorian, it suffered a 1970s revamp which left it with a bizarre layout, a ‘super outdated’ kitchen, a faux gothic fireplace, a corridor which led to nowhere – and an ‘aggressive’ staircase.</p><p>Butting out into the middle of the hallway, the stairway looks as if it’s been put in backwards, with George branding it just “wrong”’.</p><p>With a hazardous overhang which blocked the natural light, George added it was quirky to say the least.</p><p>He said: “It’s how to make not a bad shape feel so much smaller by putting the staircase in kind of the wrong way really.</p><p>“That’s ridiculous.”</p><p>As he sets out a plan to modernise the home, George says: “It’s the hall that needs the biggest re-think.</p><p>“We’ve got to turn the staircase round. It’s mad.</p><p>“The current staircase doubles back on itself, not only creating a hazardous overhang but completely blocks the window too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000506675886-e1563484987200.jpg><p>The team get to work to transform the cottage into a modern family home, by adding doors in the corridor to nowhere, scrapping the fireplace and knocking through a wall to make an open plan kitchen diner.</p><p>But the biggest change is in the entrance hall, where the ‘aggressive’ staircase finally gets turned round the right way.</p><p>Revealing their new home - which previously had some ‘seriously dodgy design features’ – George shows off their grand entrance hall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000506675778.jpg><p>Simply turning the stairs round made “all the difference”, George said.</p><p>Paul added: “From something which used to dominate, you almost don’t see it.</p><p>“When it first went in, I was almost disappointed. You were so excited about a new staircase, than it’s like ‘oh’.</p><p>“But that’s the whole point; it doesn’t get in the way anymore.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>If you're looking to sell, we reveal the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">top tips you get the most for your property.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Plus&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">property experts have revealed how to boost the value of your home.</a></p><p>While this&nbsp;interior designer shares the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">simple changes to update your home in minutes.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5huanBtZ2h8qLHOq56eZZOhrrO3xGampZxdnby2v8RmpZ6vXZ28rrGMoZizmaKZvLa%2FjKyrmqGimK60sY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./florida-man-turns-himself-in-for-murder-of-imaginary-friend.html><span>←</span><span>Florida Man Turns Himself in For Murder of Imaginary Friend</span></a>
