It’s my constant daily struggle so just like what I needed believe to do for me I now need that reminder everyday that I’m enough,” she wrote. “ALSO a reminder that I’m <a href=#>strong enough to walk through it all</a>!!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jana-Kramer-Enough-Tattoo.jpg><p>Kramer also shared that she has another soon-to-be-revealed tattoo.</p><p>“Thanks&nbsp;@winterstone&nbsp;for your work and the hang today. Gonna share my other tattoo in a few days.&nbsp;#enough,” she wrote.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Good Fight author noted that she would’ve left Caussin years ago if she<a href=#> had more self-love</a>.</p><p>“My issue is that I am drawn to people that will never fully love me because it’s something that I always want and, for some reason, I go to the people that I know, deep down,<a href=#> can never love me the way that I want to be loved</a>,” she said during the July 4 episode of her “Whine Down” podcast.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jana-Kramer-Enough-Tattoo-Mike-Caussin.jpg><p>She also noted that she “never would have stayed” after the former NFL player initially cheated on her if she “would have known [her] worth” at the time.</p><p>“My battle is I want to show and prove that I’m lovable and worthy enough and try to win that person,” she said. “That’s my issue.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2Bur62MpKmapZWneqix06xknqafqrSpedOaq62nn2KurrXDZqSio5VisKLB0qygp2WUnsOwvsKeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lyssa-chapman-arrested-during-dog-the-bounty-hunter-family-feud.html><span>←</span><span>ARRESTED For Fighting With Dog The Bounty Hunter?!</span></a>
