Hari looked destroyed as he couldn't come up with "Picasso."</p><p>He fought back, however, getting the last Daily Double for $4000, and by Final Jeopardy, Aaron had $14,000, Hari still led with $17,200, and Katie had $3,600.</p><p>Host&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;remarked: “You two were duking it out the entire round, but even with that Daily Double miss, Hari, you have the lead.”</p><p>Final Jeopardy under "Names THE SAME" read: “This first name is shared by a character introduced in 1941 & a member of royalty who is sixth in line to the British throne.”</p><p>No one came up with the correct response of “Archie," referring to the comic book Archie and Harry and Meghan’s son.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Katie didn’t finish her response; Aaron (who had around 22 correct responses) wrote “Charlotte” and dropped just $3,202 to have $10,798.</p><p>Hari (around 25 correct responses) incorrectly wrote “James” and wagered a giant $11,000 as his head slumped in disappointment and the crowd gasped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/fans-call-player-not-showing-857015832.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/fans-call-player-not-showing-857015839.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/fans-call-player-not-showing-857015835.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZWiCdHyVaKGep6CWv6XFjJ%2BYp6tdmK6tuIyorK1loKGuurHRZp2oql2jvLV50qGmsKGenHqpwcyio6KsqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ivy-wolfe-zhso-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ivy Wolfe (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
