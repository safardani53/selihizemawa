Natalie was born in Lubbock, TX and quickly showed her talent for music when she joined the choir as a child. She joined the Dixie Chicks at the age of 21 and wrote a number of songs with the all-women country band. Together, the group has won 13 Grammy Awards, 10 Country Music Awards, and 8 Academy of Country Music Awards. Natalie has been known to use her voice to make political statements and memorably in 2003 said that the Dixie Chicks were “ashamed the President of the United States [George W. Bush] is from Texas.” After that, hardly anyone in Country&nbsp; wanted to work with the band. But they had their resurgence in 2020. Here, Natalie Maines performs at ‘Cyndi Lauper and Friends: Home For The Holidays’ concert in New York on Dec. 6, 2014.
