Rihanna and Hassan called it quits in January 2020…right as she was seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attending the 2020 Yams Day Benefit Concert</a> in New York City. Here’s the scoop on Rocky, in case you didn’t know:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ASAP-Rocky-5-Things-SS-embed-2.jpg><h2><span><span><b><i><strong>1. A$AP Rocky is a rapper.</strong></i></b></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Rocky was born <strong>Rakim Mayers </strong>in Harlem on Oct. 3, 1988, and was named after <strong>Rakim</strong>, one half of <strong>Eric B & Rakim</strong>, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a>. He had a rough childhood. When Rocky was 12, his father went to jail in connection with selling drugs, and a year later, his older brother was killed in Harlem. These incidents motivated Rocky, who began rapping at age nine, to take his craft seriously, but the streets’ lure was too strong. Rocky also sold drugs but would ultimately abandon it as his rap career was taking off. Two months after walking away from the streets, his song, “Purple Swag,” broke through, making A$AP Rocky the new, hot name in hip-hop.</p><h2><span><span><i>2. A$AP is a title.</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Rocky earned the surname “A$AP” by joining the A$AP Mob, a group of rappers, producers, music video directors, and other creatives from New York City. It was formed by <strong>A$AP Yams</strong>, <strong>A$AP Bari,</strong> and <strong>A$AP Illz</strong>. Initially, it stood for “Always Strive And Prosper,” but “A$AP” has taken on many meanings over the years. Members also include <strong>A$AP Ferg</strong>, <strong>A$AP Twelvyy, </strong>and Rocky’s cousin, <strong>A$AP Nast</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ASAP-Rocky-5-Things-SS-embed-1.jpg><h2><span><span><i>3. He’s a chart-topping success.</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Rocky released Live. Love. ASAP, his debut mixtape, in 2011, which contained the previously mentioned “Purple Swag” and “Peso.” These songs build a buzz around Rocky, and in 2012, he released “Goldie” and “F-ckin’ Problems,” two tracks that established him as a hip-hop heavyweight. Both went Platinum – the latter, a collab with <strong>Drake, 2 Chainz, </strong>and <strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong> – went platinum multiple times – as did Long. Live. ASAP, Rocky’s debut solo album. Both that and the sophomore release, 2015’s At. Long. Last. ASAP, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album charts. Since his debut, Rocky has released a handful of similarly successful tracks and has featured on songs by <strong>Tinashe </strong>&nbsp;(“Pretend”), <strong>Selena Gomez </strong>(“Good For You”), <strong>Alicia Keys </strong>(“Blended Family”), <strong>G-Eazy</strong> (“No Limit”) and many more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/asap-rocky-5-things-rihanna-date-embed1.jpg><h2><i>4. Rocky was famously&nbsp;</i><span><span><i>jailed</i></span></span><i>&nbsp;in Sweden.</i></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Rocky was arrested in Stockholm, Sweden, on July 3, 2019, three days after an alleged physical incident involving <strong>Mustafa Jafari</strong>. Early footage of the incident appears to show Rocky and three other men attacking an unidentified person, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>High Snobiety</a>. Rocky posted his own footage to Instagram and alleged that Mustafa was harassing them. Rocky was charged with assault, but because a Swedish court ruled he’s a flight risk, Rocky is ordered to stay in jail until his trial.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>This resulted in a massive public outcry. Celebs like <strong>Tyler, The Creator, Diddy, Nicki Minaj,</strong> and others all threatened to boycott Sweden over this. Rocky’s supporters alleged he was unfairly punished before he was convicted of any crime. <strong>Kim Kardashian </strong>and <strong>Kanye West </strong>reportedly lobbied <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> on Rocky’s behalf, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spin</a>, which <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>resulted in then-President <strong>Donald Trump </strong></a>tweeting about it.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just spoke to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@KanyeWest</a> about his friend A$AP Rocky’s incarceration. I will be calling the very talented Prime Minister of Sweden to see what we can do about helping A$AP Rocky. So many people would like to see this quickly resolved!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 19, 2019</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just had a very good call with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@SwedishPM</a> Stefan Löfven who assured me that American citizen A$AP Rocky will be treated fairly. Likewise, I assured him that A$AP was not a flight risk and offered to personally vouch for his bail, or an alternative….</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 20, 2019</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Rocky pleaded not guilty on the first day of his trial and testified that the alleged victim started fighting with Rocky’s bodyguard. Rocky and his co-defendants were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>released</a> from jail on Aug. 2, and about two weeks later, they were found guilty of assault. The three were ordered to pay roughly $1,3000 in damages to Jafari and cover his legal fees.</p><h2><i>5. He’s a vegan.</i></h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Rocky has been<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> romantically linked</a> to <strong>Iggy Azaela, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Chanel Iman</a>,</strong> and <strong>Kendall Jenner</strong>. In 2012, he transitioned to vegetarianism, and his 2019 single, “Babuska Boi,” indicated that he’s now a vegan. “I ain’t duckin’ n—-s, I ain’t duckin’ bullets either / Sh-t, I ain’t duck sauce since I became a vegan.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KutK3PZqmom5uuenV%2BlmpsbHBf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chord-overstreet-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Photos Of The Actor &amp;amp; Singer Hollywood Life</span></a>
