This time around, the gang is trading in snakes for the highly invasive African land snail. Among the new cast members who signed on for Season 2 are <a href=#>Kyle Mooney</a> and Glee’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dot-Marie Jones</a>. According to Craig, inviting a few new faces on set took the show to a “whole 'nother level.”</p><p>“Dot-Marie Jones — she murdered, killed her role. And then she’s got these two children who were insanely funny. They were incredible,” Craig said of Joe Massingill and Katie Kershaw, who play brother-sister duo Ray-Nathan and Natalie-Rae in Season 2.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>In his interview with Distractify, the bachelor also got candid about being an honorary TV dad onscreen. The Killing It star doesn’t have kids of his own, but he draws most of his inspiration from his parents when taking up the mantle of Craig Foster.</p><p>“Anytime I'm playing a father, I just defer to my father,” he told us. “If I can be half the man he is, I'm doing real good in life,” the actor shared. “And even my mother.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">“Killing It” star Craig Robinson teases Season 3 of the Peacock series.</h2><p>There’s no telling when the ongoing writers' and actors' strike will come to an end, which makes it even less likely that we’ll get word as to whether or not Killing It is returning to the small screen anytime soon.</p><p>Before the strike got started and put the 2023–2024 television schedule on hold, Craig told us that he was just as in the dark about Season 3 as we were.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>That said, when and if the series is renewed for a third season (fingers crossed), he’s letting Killing It writers take the lead. “One thing about this show — even when it was pitched to me, even when we were, you know, in a table reads — I didn't realize what was going on in the first place,” Craig said.</p><p>He added: “I didn't know it was as dark as it got and edgy. I knew it was gonna be have heart and humor and some edge but it turned into the perfect vehicle. I absolutely love it. So I'm gonna leave that to the writers.”</p><p>Season 2 of Killing It drops on Peacock Thursday, Aug. 17.</p><p><strong>This interview was conducted before the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild of America strikes began.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLatuMinnmahpGKws63IoGSrp5Keu7S7zWaqnpmjpLtufw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wwvhpckff7nwxldtdvihbmgccuqrkb9u.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Concacaf Nations League Season 2023 Episode 72: St. Kitts &amp;amp; Nevis vs. Saint Lucia</span></a>
