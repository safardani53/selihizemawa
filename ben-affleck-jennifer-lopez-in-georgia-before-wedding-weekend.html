Twenty years patient,” the “On the Floor” singer — who shares<a href=#> twins Max and Emme</a> with ex-husband<a href=#> <strong>Marc Anthony</strong></a> — <a href=#>wrote via her “On the J. Lo” newsletter in July</a>, hours after&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Us&nbsp;</i>confirmed the pair had obtained a marriage license</a>. “Exactly what we wanted. Last night we flew to Vegas, stood in line for a license with four other couples, all making the same journey to the wedding capital of the world.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “So with the best witnesses you could ever imagine, a dress from an old movie and a jacket from Ben’s closet, we read our own vows<a href=#> in the little chapel</a> and gave one another the rings we’ll wear for the rest of our lives. … But in the end, it was the best possible wedding we could have imagined. One we dreamed of long ago and one made real (in the eyes of the state, Las Vegas, a pink convertible and one another) at very, very long last.”</p><p class=p1>Lopez and Affleck were joined by <a href=#>several of their children</a> during the Vegas outing.

I’ve had second chances in my career,” Affleck <a href=#>said of their reunion during a January interview with&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>WSJ. Magazine</a>.&nbsp;</i>“I’ve had second chances as a human being. Life is difficult, and we are always failing and hopefully learning from those failures. The one thing you really need to avail yourself of the opportunities provided from that growth is the second chance. I’ve definitely tried to take advantage of that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnZ5irqeyy56apGWamruvtcWeqWakn6Wyu3nIp2SgnZ%2BntKqtjJucn6eimnq4scOdoKefXayyprfEp5to</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-angela-yee-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Angela Yee Dating Now</span></a>
