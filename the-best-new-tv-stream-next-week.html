No, not Ghostbusters – you need Lockwood & Co, a supernatural detective agency formed by a trio of talented teenage ghosthunters, ready and willing to take on the most dangerous of deadly spirits.</p><p>In this spectacular eight-part series, the team - Anthony Lockwood (Cameron Chapman), George Karim (Ali Hadji-Heshmati) and the psychically gifted Lucy Carlyle (Ruby Stokes) - &nbsp;find themselves on a thrilling mission to unravel a terrifying and momentous mystery, all the while trying to stay independent of other, adult-run supernatural agencies.</p><p>Also starring Luke Treadaway, Morven Christie and Ivanno Jeremiah – and written and directed by Joe Cornish (Attack The Block, Adam & Joe) – it’s a thrilling and fright-laden young adult detective adventure that’s sure to appeal to fans of Harry Potter and The Midnight Club.</p><p><strong>Physical: 100 - Available from Tuesday</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/new-available-tuesday-korea-continues-789680229.jpg><p>Korea continues to knock it out of the park, creating high-concept, slightly dystopian shows, which appeal to a global audience.</p><p>This one's definitely not for the faint hearted as one hundred contestants in top physical shape go head to head in a series of gruelling physical challenges. The game has a very gladiatorial feel to it, with an ominous voice telling the contestants they're here to find the most perfect physical body, regardless of race, age or gender.</p><p>These men and women are all seriously buff, but who has the stamina to be the last one standing?</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Streaming</h2></p><p><strong>You People - Available from Friday</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/people-available-friday-cultures-clash-789683072.jpg><p>Cultures clash in this big-name comedy movie starring Jonah Hill and Lauren London as unlikely lovers Ezra and Amira, whose impending marriage is causing consternation for their family and friends.</p><p>Can two people from such different backgrounds go the distance as they battle society’s expectations and the growing culture wars in LA?</p><p>The trailer teases a squirm-inducing dinner party between Ezra’s woke Jewish folks (played by David Duchovny and Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and Amira’s Muslim parents (Eddie Murphy and Nia Long), and with the awkward dial set to maximum, this Netflix original will have you people laughing and confronting your own biases in equal measure. &nbsp;</p><h3>PARAMOUNT+</h3><p><strong>Wolf Pack - Available from Friday</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/teen-wolf-aftermath-californian-wildfire-789688148.jpg><p>Buffy is back! (Well, kinda). Sarah Michelle Gellar returns to the supernatural TV world in this exciting new teen drama from the creator of Teen Wolf.</p><p>In the aftermath of a Californian wildfire, a long-dormant, terrifying supernatural creature is awakened. This changes the lives of a&nbsp;group of teenagers, who then have to work together to uncover the secret that connects them all.</p><p>Sarah plays highly regarded arson investigator Kristin Ramsey in the show, who is personally invested in the case and looks like a tough cookie. Also starring Rodrigo Santoro (Lost), this looks set to be a supernatural drama with bite.</p><p><strong>The Chemistry Of Death - continues Thursday</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/harry-treadaway-still-haunted-memories-789691828.jpg><p>Last week’s opening episode of this tension-drenched psychological thriller introduced us to an intriguing new crime-solver: former forensic anthropologist-turned-GP Dr David Hunter (Harry Treadaway).</p><p>Still being haunted by the memories of a terrible tragedy in his recent past, this week David reluctantly continues to help the police with their investigation into the murdered body found in the woods.</p><p>But the discovery of two more bodies causes tensions to rise even higher in the village. Meanwhile, Harry’s findings leave police concerned that they could be on the hunt of not one but two killers - and there’s a shocking twist in store. Riveting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The L Word Generation Q - Saturday</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kate-moennig-sophie-determined-challenge-789693527.jpg><p>Season three of the acclaimed drama sequel reaches its climax in typically turbulent and thrilling fashion. Shane (Kate Moennig) and Sophie are determined to challenge old ways, and Alice (Leisha Hailey) realises that ‘The One’ may be much closer than she imagined.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dani tries desperately to distract herself from Dre, Micah and Maribel start making plans to become parents and Finlay takes an important step towards adulthood. Expect another heady dose of love, lust and laughter.</p><h3>OTHER SERVICES</h3><p><strong>KSI: In Real Life - Prime Video from Thursday</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ksi-media-work-crystal-house-787861411.jpg><p>World conquering YouTuber, successful musician, boxer and businessman - life surely couldn’t get much sweeter for KSI. But while his career has never been better, the Watford lad - born Olajide Olatunji and JJ to his friends - has seen his personal life suffer, resulting in a distancing from his parents, a falling out with his brother and the damaging of his relationship with his girlfriend.</p><p>In this access-all-areas film, JJ invites us into his world, accompanying him as he goes on tour, and lifting the lid on his life and career so far. Featuring interviews with his family and friends and moments of real vulnerability from JJ himself, it’s a no holds barred portrait of the ultimate 21st century internet icon.</p><p><strong>Deep Fake Neighbour Wars - ITVX from Thursday</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tiger-aspect-productions-reproduced-editorial-787549610.jpg><p>Catford handyman Idris Elba clashing with his housemate, bus driver Kim Kardashian; Southend single mum Greta Thunberg having a spat with nearby florist Conor McGregor and scaffolder Ariana Grande… welcome to the uncanny world of Deep Fake Neighbour Wars.</p><p>This sketch show imagines a world in which international stars live normal lives in unlikely parts of the UK and have petty feuds with their equally recognisable neighbours.</p><p>So far so Stella Street (remember that brilliant 90s comedy?) but there’s a twist. Although talented impressionists, including Francine Lewis, Al Foran, Aurie Styla and Katia Kvinge, provide the voices and bodies of the famous folk, their faces are generated by cutting edge ‘deep fake’ CGI technology, which makes them look exactly like the real thing.</p><p>As a result, watching the show can be an oddly distracting experience. But once you settle in, there’s plenty of fun to be had seeing the likes of Rihanna, Adele and Harry Kane squabbling over garish Christmas decorations or lawn-spoiling paddling pools.</p><p><strong>Extraordinary - Disney+ from Wednesday</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mairead-tyers-jen-sofia-oxenham-789694976.jpg><p>Young Londoner Jen (Emma Moran) lives in a world where everyone gets their own superpower after they turn 18. Sounds good, doesn’t it?</p><p>The trouble is, Jen is now 25 and unlike all her friends and flatmates, she still hasn’t got hers. Cue a life of feeling inadequate, self-conscious and unsure of where she fits in. If you can imagine a mash up between Sex Education, Everything I Know About Love and, erm, Encanto, chances are it would be very much like this charming and witty coming-of-age comedy.</p><p>Packed with funny, snarky one-liners, impressive special effects and a hugely likeable cast, it’s a show that’s as exceptional as the title suggests.</p><p><strong>Shrinking - AppleTV+ from Friday</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/care-teenage-daughter-stay-professional-789695657.jpg><p>Jimmy (Jason Segel) is a Californian therapist attempting to come to terms with the death of his wife, while still trying - and usually failing - to care for his teenage daughter and stay professional in his demanding job. But one day, he realises that by telling his patients what he really thinks of their troubles - and bending the rules of his profession until they nearly break - he might be able to make even more of a difference.</p><p>Funny and affecting - and also starring Harrison Ford as Jimmy’s despairing boss, Paul - Shrinking is full of heart and warmth and likeable characters, which should come as no surprise when you discover it was co-created by Ted Lasso star and writer Brett Goldstein.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Under The Vines - AcornTV from Monday</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/free-spirited-kiwi-socialite-daisy-789698476.jpg><p>Let's raise a glass of the good stuff to celebrate season two of this charming dramedy set on a New Zealand vineyard. Rebecca Gibney (The Dressmaker) is free spirited Kiwi socialite&nbsp;Daisy Monroe, while Charles Edwards (The Crown) plays stuffy London lawyer Louis Oakley.</p><p>This odd couple were thrown together when they inherited the failing Oakley Wines, and the romantic hurdles just keep on coming when a handsome new doctor in town catches Daisy's eye. A fish-out-of-water tale which finds two city slickers in over their heads in a gorgeous setting full of quirky locals, this is perfect wish-fulfilment telly.</p><p><strong>Judy Justice - Amazon Freevee from Monday</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/new-amazon-freevee-monday-often-789699277.jpg><p>Often imitated, never bettered, Judge Judy Sheindlin pioneered the arbitration-based reality court show genre. The former Manhattan Family Court Judge has a global fanbase thanks to her matter-of-fact approach to conflict resolution, and now she's back to oversee more real-life small claims disputes.</p><p>A Christmas Day dog attack, which sets neighbour against neighbour and newlyweds suing their wedding planner are just two new cases which require a good dash of Sheindlin common sense.</p><p>Once again, the court staff includes New York Law School graduate Sarah Rose, who is Judy's granddaughter and acts as her legal analyst on the show.</p><p><strong>David & Annie: After The 90 Days - Discovery+ from Tuesday</strong></p><p>90 Day Fiancé is the hit dating and matrimony show in which a US citizen spends time with their foreign-born partner. Now, one of the most popular couples to emerge from the franchise - husband and wife David Toborowsky and Annie Suwan - are back again.</p><p>This season they're travelling to Phuket in Thailand, where Annie is from, with the intention of bringing Annie's brother Jordan and cousin Amber back to America. But their plan doesn't run smoothly, with David and Annie, who have a 24-year age gap, unexpectedly facing the possibility of hearing the pitter-patter of tiny feet...</p><p><strong>The Defence - All4 from Friday</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/joanna-chylka-magdelena-cielecka-700027896.jpg><p>Anyone who caught the first two series of this impressive Polish crime thriller will be delighted to know that maverick lawyer Joanna Chylka (Magdalena Cielecka) is back. Despite having turned her back on her career at the end of the last series - and turned her attention to drinking rather a lot - Joanna decides to return to action when she’s approached for help by a man who’s been accused of murdering his wife and daughter.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>But what should have been a straightforward inheritance case soon presents Joanna with an unexpected shot at getting revenge at her old colleagues. Can she find her way back to the top - and help her client at the same time? Another intricately plotted and tense crime treat.
