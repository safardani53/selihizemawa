"And on the flip side, to really show the warmth, generosity, and then the variety that both the people and the culture sort of exude."</p><p>A Tourist's Guide to Love was filmed on location in Vietnam and gives viewers a glimpse at life in the major cities such as Ho Chi Minh City, as well as showcases the country's rural areas and villages.</p><p>Though the director emphasizes the beauty of Vietnam, shooting in a foreign country did come with a few challenges, specifically, the weather.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>"Physically it was like 90-degree weather all the time and 100% humidity, so it's really hot and sweaty," he said. "With that said, working in Vietnam was an incredible experience," the director added. "Because the Vietnamese people, the crew, government, the location, whatever, they were super enthused to have us there."</p><p>The film's director told us that the people of Vietnam were "incredibly welcoming" to the cast and crew. During filming, popular city streets were shut down to accommodate the actors as they shot scenes.</p><p>Though the movie stars Rachael Leigh Cook and Scott Ly, Tsuchida feels that Vietnam is "a character [in and of] itself."</p><p>He continued, "I think one of the things that I really love about making movies like this and using a lot of the local talent is, I start watching the Western talent interact with, like, the local talent and [...] you actually realize as far away, as foreign as Vietnam is compared to Los Angeles, how [many] more similarities that we all have as human beings than differences."</p><p>You can stream A Tourist's Guide to Love on Netflix on April 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflnq1u9SroKyso2K0trXDnmStp12hvLexjJ%2BgpaWZo7RuuM6cmK2hn6PA</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-raul-de-molina-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Raul De Molina Dating Now</span></a>
