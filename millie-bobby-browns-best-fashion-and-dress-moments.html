Her bow-adorned space buns and rosy lips finished the playful look.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>After stepping out in a number of other looks by Calvin Klein, the Enola Holmes actress moved on to another major fashion house. In April 2022, Louis Vuitton named Brown as a brand ambassador. “I met [creative director] <strong>Nicolas Ghesquière</strong> six years ago and have been a fan of his work with Louis Vuitton ever since,” she said in a statement at the time, per <a href=#>Women’s Wear Daily</a>. “Today, I am proud and honored to be joining the Louis Vuitton family. Truly a pinch me, full circle moment.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The following month, Brown celebrated her relationship with the luxury label at the Stranger Things season 4 premiere in New York City. On the red carpet, she turned up the heat in a white silk gown by Louis Vuitton that featured a high slit and a belt at the bodice.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>For glam, Brown rocked a subtle but noticeable metallic eye, rosy cheeks and a glossy lip —&nbsp;courtesy of makeup artist Buster Knight. The glowing beat featured products from Brown’s <a href=#>Florence by Mills</a> cosmetics label. She launched the beauty venture in August 2019, calling the brand the “love” of her life.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>The idea and direction came straight from the young beauty’s personal experience. “I wanted to come into the space because there was a gap in the market for young people,” Brown told WWD at the time. “I guess I could never find anything that I liked to put on my face and it felt good. I’d take off my makeup and boom, another pimple would appear.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Brown has since celebrated another love in her life.
