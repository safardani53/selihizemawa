Life doesn't always bring what they expect."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>The dad made it his mission to keep the family’s right to maintain the pirate ship - featuring a deck and a wooden pool.</p><p>He said: "We are not above the law, but don't make me take it down."</p><p>Konstantinidis quickly complied with the mandate and moved the structure further from the neighbouring fence and divided the structure into separate pieces.</p><p>But, along with his wife Voula, he was left furious at the actions of the petty neighbour who failed to speak to them before lodging the “hurtful” complaint.</p><p>Voula said: "They don't understand why our neighbours are being like that.</p><p>"What do you say to them (your kids) as a parent,</p><p>"You try to put their mind at ease. We told them no matter what they will have some sort of pool."</p><h2>SETTING SAIL</h2><p>A year later, keeping their promise, the couple renovated and updated the ship in keeping with city bylaws.</p><p>It included improved safety measures, such as locks to the covered water area and a chain fence.</p><p>Importantly, the structure has become a staple of the local community, bringing lots of joy to other children in the neighbourhood.</p><p>It also sparked an interest in construction among Konstantinidis’s two children, who labelled their dad’s skills as “the best in the world.”</p><p>"Maybe one day, I'll build a skyscraper," son Steven told CBC.</p><p>While his brother Michael added: "What I feel about my dad building this, is he's the best dad in the world and I appreciate it.”</p><p>Despite the happy ending for this family, not all neighbour feuds come to a such a pleasant conclusion.</p><p>In one case, a dad claimed his life was turned upside down after his <a href=#>neighbour decided to knock down his house</a> and rebuild it with decking high enough to see into his garden.</p><p>The father said he wasn't told about his neighbour drastic redesign plans until demolition started next door.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>And a woman was left fuming after her neighbour allegedly <a href=#>"crammed" a huge paddling pool</a> into her garden.</p><p>The raging resident said the neighbour "practically lived in it" all week despite sitting just metres away from her own property. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoZ2gI9rb3Bnnpq2qLTBqKyrZZakv6Sxw2abmpxdmba0ucCnq6WdXaC2pb%2BMqaCrmaSaerS0yKlm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./love-island.html><span>←</span><span>Love Island Season 2 Episodes</span></a>
