The 29-year-old will be the 14th Time Lord and the first person of color to assume the main role in the popular science fiction drama.&nbsp;Gatwa is a Scottish actor who was born in Rwanda and is best known for his performance in the Netflix series Sex Education. He told a news organization:</p><p>“It feels incredible. It’s an incredible honor. This is an iconic role that has become an institution. I’m pleased to have been given the baton, and I’m going to do my best.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ncuti-Gatwa-3.jpg alt="Ncuti Gatwa" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Ncuti Gatwa’s career in the midst of Doctor Who casting</h2><p>The actor is most recognized for his role as Eric Effiong in Sex Education, a fictitious series about high school students seeking help from an underground sex therapy clinic. Gatwa received Best Actor at the 2020 Scottish BAFTAs for his work in the series.&nbsp;Gatwa, who is nominated for Best Male Performance in a Comedy Program at the BAFTAs this year, will now portray the 14th Doctor in the program. In a “blazing” audition, he wowed showrunner Russell T Davies.</p><p>“It was our last audition.” It was our last one. We thought we had someone, but then he walked in and snatched it. I’m completely overjoyed. It’s going to be a spectacular future.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ncuti-Gatwa-4.jpg alt="Ncuti Gatwa" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ncuti Gatwa will join the long-running science fiction series, which follows an extraterrestrial Time Lord who travels across space and time, just in time for its 60th anniversary in 2023.&nbsp;The new Doctors include Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Matt Smith, and Peter Capaldi.&nbsp;The Nyarugenge, Kigali, Rwanda native indicated that he would “certainly do my own thing” with the role rather than imitate any past Doctor.&nbsp;Working with Davies, he added in a statement, was “a dream come true:</p><p>“His writing is vibrant, exhilarating, immensely brilliant, and brimming with danger – a figurative playground for actors.” The whole cast has been really hospitable and has given their all to the production. So, as intimidating as it is, I am conscious that I am entering a very supportive family. I may only have one heart, unlike the Doctor, but I’m giving it everything to this program.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Ncuti Gatwa is so good on SEX EDUCATION, a lightning rod of charm and comedic timing. A star from the moment he popped on screen. He’s going to be phenomenal as the next Doctor. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#DoctorWho</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IiM1qjd8UC</a></p><p>— Robert Daniels (@812filmreviews) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">May 8, 2022</a></p><p>Juno Dawson, author and podcaster for Doctor Who, called it “wonderful, perfect casting.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGilnK2knnqordOwmGavmaG5bsDApJxmp6aav26t0maroZ1dobKisIyamq2nomK2r3nDqJqtp6JixKm7jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./love-and-hip-hop-atlanta.html><span>←</span><span>Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop Atlanta Season 9 Episodes</span></a>
