She was perfectly fine before!!" the debate raged.</p><p>"It’s so crazy to me how tiny her waist is in comparison," one person said in response to a series of snaps of Kim in a bikini.</p><p>"She’s always been pretty slim but her waist used to be so much wider than it is now.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE KIM KARDASHIAN">READ MORE KIM KARDASHIAN</h2><p>"I think that rumor that she had ribs removed is way far out there, but how the hell did she get her waist so damn tiny like what surgery is that!!??"</p><p>Others agreed that Kim, now 41, looked healthier and more natural in her 20's, when she first became a star.</p><p>"When she did she become obsessed with the super tiny waist?? Looked fine before," one fan commented.</p><p>Another added: "Wow, she used to look so good. Hip dips and all, she actually looked normal."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>And one fan felt some of the pictures showed off Kim's animal instincts.</p><p>"The one where she is swinging North, she looks like a queen ant."</p><h2 id=skim-tight>SKIM TIGHT</h2><p>While Kim hasn't commented about her look either way, she has been slammed as <a href=#>out of touch</a> for suggesting fans wear a skintight SKIMS top to WORK as an “office look.”</p><p>The SKIMS&nbsp;<a href=#>TikTok</a>&nbsp;account recently shared a&nbsp;<a href=#>video</a>&nbsp;that showed a model trying on the tight long sleeve top.</p><p>In the clip, the model showed how the same top could be worn for a “date night,” “to the office” and a “weekend hike.”</p><p>While the top was paired with a tiny skirt for the date night option and biker shorts for the hike,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kim’s</a>&nbsp;brand suggested customers wear the top with camouflage pants to work.</p><p>Shortly after the brand shared the video,&nbsp;<a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>&nbsp;fans rushed to&nbsp;<a href=#>Reddit</a>&nbsp;to shut down the idea that the top is work appropriate.</p><h2 id=skim-appropriate>SKIM-APPROPRIATE</h2><p>Alongside a screenshot from the clip, the initial Reddit user wrote: "THIS IS A OFFICE LOOK??"</p><p>The backlash continued as another added: "Tell me you never worked in an office without telling me you’ve never worked in an office."</p><p>A third chimed in: "I’m getting a talking from HR if I wore that."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>While one person joked the outfit is only work appropriate for "the school counselor at Euphoria High," another added: "It’s because they’re so out of touch with reality that they think this is an appropriate office look."</p><p>"Imagine HR having to figure out how to tell you to wear a bra so your nips aren’t showing.
