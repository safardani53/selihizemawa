At times very much so. Is this a worthy showcase of an Emmy winning comedy?</p><p>Probably not, but it would still warrant discussion in that arena, because the show still does what it does very well, as Wednesday’s show proved.</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span><p>"The Long Honeymoon," which could also apply to Modern‘s Emmy run, come to think of it, was almost more about the Dunphys than Cam and Mitch.</p><p>Phil, Claire, Haley, Luke and his unsettling teenager voice are having the best summer ever, in no small part because buzzkill Alex is off volunteering.</p><p>The use of cutaways and the slapstick gags worked well, especially given the abruptness of their summer bliss crashing down as soon as Alex returned.</p><p>Haley’s webcam reveal and subsequent outakes were pretty amazing, too, and having to watch Phil eat plums all night was deliciously awkward.</p><p>Mitch and Cam’s story stretched the limits of believability just a bit, even for Cam, whose penchant for theatrics is rarely considered overselling it.</p><p>Would he really crash Mitch’s work event and do that, no matter how smitten he is? No, but it was worth it to set up the honeymoon phase’s unraveling.</p><p>The "three-monthaversary” romantic display he put together led to one ridiculous visual and verbal gem after another. Is fairy time over yet?!</p><p>Finally, we have Gloria, Jay and Manny, who sadly are the weak link if you <a href=#>watch Modern Family online</a> a lot of times, and this was true last night.</p><p>Making high-maintenance Gloria look frumpy and potentially embarrass Jay in public got its share of laughs, no doubt, but it felt forced at times as well.</p><p>The age, cultural and lifestyle differences between the two will always provide material, but this felt a little recycled, in concept if not execution.</p><p>What did you think of the premiere? Are you still tuning in to the five-time Emmy-winning series, or have you moved on to bigger and better things?</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2psX2WGcLnOnZyrpl2brq61y7JkrJ2RqLyveZVmnKmho6SxpnmQZqmem5GlerW0xGafqKaVrrqwu81mp6GZo5p6qr%2BMqK1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./200m-london-mansion-makes-buckingham-palace-dull.html><span>←</span><span>The 200m mansion The Queen said 'makes Buckingham Palace look dull' part of amazing life of racing</span></a>
