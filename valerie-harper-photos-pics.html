Mary played the best friend to a transplant in Minneapolis who landed a job at a news station, and the show followed their career and social escapades.

The CBS show paved the way to Valerie’s own spin-off series, ‘Rhoda.’</p><p>Born on Aug. 22, 1939, Valerie entered the entertainment scene by dancing on Broadway and performed in productions like ‘Wildcat’ (alongside Lucille Ball!) and ‘Subways Are For Sleeping.’ Thanks to her time touring with Second City improv theater, Valerie was spotted by a casting agent which led to her big break on ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show’ in 1970.</p><p>After her successful run on the sitcom — she won four Emmys and a Golden Globe — she starred on the television series ‘Valerie’ and ‘City.’ She also served as a voice actress for numerous characters on ‘The Simpsons’ between 2013 and 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Valerie was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2009, and then brain cancer in 2013, but bravely fought on until passing away on Aug. 30, 2019. She was 80 years old.
