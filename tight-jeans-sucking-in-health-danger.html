A pelvic floor expert has revealed the damage you can do by trying to look trim and squeezing your stomach.
It can be done either by trying to keep your belly physically pulled in by tensing your abs, or by forcing yourself into tight waistbands.
Both can have an impact on your body, and can be far more damaging than just feeling uncomfortable or self-conscious."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Your abs may also get so used to being engaged that they become less responsive to it, limiting your body’s ability to see improvements from exercises targeting that muscle group."</p><p>She explained it isn't helpful for mental wellbeing either, as if you "suck in" habitually and then manage to let go, it can feel like you don't look good and a vicious cycle is created.</p><h2>Is it permanent?</h2><p>If you develop so-called "Hourglass Syndrome" it isn't permanent, but can cause problems in the long term if not treated properly.</p><p>Just as it takes time for sucking in to become second nature, it takes time to unlearn it.</p><p>The first step to kicking the habit is to be aware you’re doing it. Be conscious of what you’re doing to your body and when.</p><p>Stephanie said: "You may find you have to retrain your muscles through belly breath work and abdominal massage. Take relaxed breaths in that fill your stomach instead of filling only your chest.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Lastly, if you have body confidence issues that are made worse by having to dress up and socialise over the Christmas period, only every wear something that you feel good in – not what you think is on-trend.</p><p>"Dressing for your body shape (rather than trying to change it) can help to knock these anxieties on the head."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Woman 'nearly died' from a wedgie after wearing high-cut denim jeans on first date and developing sepsis</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIFzgpBsbHFnpJ60qcCMo5yapqNiwLavyqKloGWZo3qpscClq6FllJa7qLHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./franklin-graham-19520714-html.html><span>←</span><span>Franklin Graham (Religious Leader) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
