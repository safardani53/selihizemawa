Daly’s Illustrious CareerIn 1991, Daly came out of nowhere and never having seen the championship’s course. But after making the field as the ninth alternate, he opened with a 69 and powered his way to winning the US PGA title at the Crooked Stick Golf Club in Indiana."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It was all downhill from there, but he gave everyone flashbacks of his 1991 magic for a moment.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Daly’s Illustrious Career</h2><p>In 1991, Daly came out of nowhere and never having seen the championship’s course. But after <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">making</a> the field as the ninth alternate, he opened with a 69 and powered his way to winning the US PGA title at the Crooked Stick Golf Club in Indiana. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Daly’s win stunned the golf community, as he was an underdog. His improbable win earned him a lifetime exemption for the PGA Championship, and he was given the moniker “Long John” for his exceptional driving distance.</p><p>The golf champion won the second major of his career in 1995 after defeating Costantino Rocca in a playoff at the Open Championship at St. Andrews. However, the American golfer struggled for form since, and his last PGA win was in 2004.&nbsp;</p><h2>Daly’s Dwindling Net Worth&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The professional golfer has a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $2 million. He earned all of it from his various brand endorsements and sale of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">merchandise</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His net worth should be worth much&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">more</a>, but Daly’s penchant for gambling and alcohol dwindled his fortune over the years.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Daly’s gambling, as well as his substance abuse, was the biggest obstacle to a better career. He admitted in a 2016 interview that he lost at least $55 million in bad bets alone.</p><p>In his 2006 autobiography, he revealed his issues with compulsive gambling and iterated that the year before his book release, he experienced his life’s worst losses. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>At the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas, Daly got on the slot machine with $5,000 but lost $1.5 million in a horrific losing streak and found himself unable to stop.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But Daly’s substance abuse was equally notorious and common knowledge. He famously golfed with a cigarette in his mouth.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Daly would even resort to drinking before big games. He was constantly in and out of alcohol rehabs, and in 2008, his swing coach abandoned him after growing frustrated with his drinking problem. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>That year, he was found drunk outside of a Hooters restaurant.&nbsp;</p><h2>Daly Refused $1 Million</h2><p>Daly’s various vices and penchant for outlandish and colorful outfits may make him the most outrageous golfer ever.</p><p>He&nbsp;definitely makes for an interesting character, from losing almost $100 million in gambling to refusing $1 million to tank the 1995 Open Championship.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>His 2014 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with&nbsp;Graham Bensinger&nbsp;recently gained traction. In the brief clip, Daly claimed a gambler approached him and offered him a million dollars if he agreed to lose on purpose, but he turned down the proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>I said, “Go [expletive] yourself. No way.”</p><p>The offer was five times more than what he would have earned from winning the tournament. Daly was still a rookie, and someone might have seen him as a competition, particularly after his 1991 win.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>It was a good thing he refused, as he became even more famous after winning the tournament.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiqqaeiqcBwts6hpWackaHGbrrErWSwp6KptW%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-starks.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Scott Starks net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
