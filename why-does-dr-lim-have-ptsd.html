In a hair-raising scene, the doctor's motorcycle ride took a terrifying turn — and she ended up in a minor crash. Season 4<strong> </strong>of the medical drama charts the complicated process whereby she tries to come to terms with PTSD. But so, what caused the condition? <a href=#>Why does she have PTSD?&nbsp;</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dr. Lim developed PTSD on 'The Good Doctor' after working throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</h2><p>Season 4 of The Good Doctor puts <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Lim</a> in a difficult predicament. On the one hand, the doctor has to overcome <a href=#>the tragic loss of Dr. Neil Melendez's</a><strong> </strong>(Nicholas Gonzalez). On the other, she starts to exhibit the symptoms of PTSD, which are likely the results of having to work day after day on the frontline of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Determined to keep her title as the chief of surgery at the San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital, she tries to ignore the increasingly crippling symptoms as long as she can — until they slowly but steadily start to seep into every aspect of her life. The episode titled "Lim" captures one of the first times the PTSD symptoms became manifested in such a way that they put Dr. Lim's life and personal well-being at risk.&nbsp;</p><p>Take, for instance, "Irresponsible Salad Bar Practices," in which the highly successful trauma surgeon and chief of surgery admits that she has decided to start taking medication for the symptoms during a casual conversation with a few other colleagues.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I started taking [Sertraline] ... for PTSD," she told Dr. Marcus Andrews (Hill Harper) and Dr. Claire Browne (Antonia Thomas). &nbsp;</p><p>The confession marked a breakthrough for Dr. Lim, who insisted on keeping the condition a secret for the majority of Season 4. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Dr. Lim's insistence on dealing with the symptoms alone created a rift between her and Claire. As the previous episodes of The Good Doctor revealed, Dr. Lim has a whole host of reasons to reject her help, including Claire's past romantic involvement with Dr. Melendez, and the simple fact that she is her subordinate at the hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>Although they both have had experiences with PTSD, this alone doesn't provide them much common ground. Determined to save her reputation as the person in authority, Dr. Lim continues to turn down Claire's attempts to help.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Season 4 of The Good Doctor received a great deal of applause from critics and fans alike for its rare ability to nail down fundamental truths about the issues those struggling to manage the symptoms of PTSD have to face.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Fantastic episode tonight, tackling so many extremely important issues at once, so good! @GoodDoctorABC @gooddrwriters Thank you for that!
