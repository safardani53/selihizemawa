Amber Heard’s fist."</p><p>From there, McGivern recalled that he and Depp were both momentarily in shock following the punch.</p><p>"The initial look on his face kind of mirrored mine, kind of a look of shock," McGivern recalled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"What just happened, where did that come from."</p><p>At that point, McGivern recalls, he instructed Depp to leave the property.</p><p>"I decided I wasn’t going to let Mr. Depp get hit any more.I told him we were leaving, it wasn’t up to him any more. Just for his safety," he said.</p><p>"I’d let him get hit by a Red Bull can, I’d let him get punched… my job is to ensure the safety and well-being of my clients, and I felt like I hadn’t done that.

It wasn’t black and blue yet."</p><p>Also taking the stand on Monday was Depp’s talent manager Jack Whigham.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Whigham’s testimony may not be as tabloid-friendly as the recent tales of blow-out fights, but he’s crucial to Depp’s claim that he lost out on millions in income as a result of <a href=#>Heard’s abuse claims</a>.</p><p>According to Whigham, In the nearly four years since Heard published her op-ed in the Washington Post, Depp has received zero offers to star in studio films.</p><p>The manager says that even Depp’s most recent project — the low-budget indie film Minamata — was jeopardized by the article, in which Heard identified herself as a survivor of domestic violence, but did not mention Depp by name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"It was very very difficult to keep Minamata together, the financing became shaky, the budget came down, Johnny’s fee had to come down to save the movie," Whigham testified.</p><p>Whigham also confirmed that plans for a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean movie — for which Depp reportedly would have been paid $22.5 million — were scrapped in the wake of Heard’s allegations.</p><p>Obviously, it wasn’t a good day for Team Heard, but with three weeks of testimony remaining, this trial is far from over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Insiders say Heard is still planning to take the stand at some point.</p><p>And if her testimony is anywhere near as explosive as Depp’s it could easily shift the balance, both in the courtroom and in the court of public opinion.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WCcK3Mm5yrZZiarrOwjKmsp5uYmrFuts6hpaexXZmysbyMoqVmrJiaeqetwp5krKiZqXqwuoyapZ1lpJ2%2FpsOMoJho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fiddler-on-the-roof-star-chaim-topol-dead-at-87.html><span>←</span><span>'Fiddler on the Roof' Star was 87</span></a>
