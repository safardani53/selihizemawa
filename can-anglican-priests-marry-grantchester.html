The British crime drama set in the ‘50s, Grantchester, is already on its fifth season (the newest season premiered June 14).

While the Anglican Church under Henry VIII had to remain unmarried and certainly celibate, Edward VI did away with this restriction when he became King of England in 1547.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Anglican priests can be married</u></a> when they become priests, or get married while they’re priests. There’s one exception to this, and that’s if you got divorced: If you’re an Anglican priest, you’re not allowed to remarry. (Apparently you can if you live in the U.S. and Canada, which are more lax about these things.)</p>Article continues below advertisement<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Knowing this might give Grantchester fans some hope. And it certainly might give reporter Ellie Harding (Lauren Carse) some, as well. As soon as she meets Will, fans could tell she felt some ways about him. Too bad Geordie told her, “I wouldn’t bother, he’s celibate.” Ellie replies, “Oh, you’re that Will. Should change your name to Won’t.”&nbsp;</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>So, Will can definitely have a partner. And he can get married. But will he? That kiss between Ellie and Will was pretty steamy, so IDK, Will. We respect your choices, but an entire life without intimacy?! Only time will tell.&nbsp;</p><p>Be sure to tune into Grantchester every Sunday on PBS at 9 p.m. (EST) to see whether Will and Ellie's relationship ultimately blossoms into something more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6vecCnnqWhk5a7brzRopysrKNiuqK%2B0bJkoKqRo8GktMSsq56q</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natalie-maines-pics-dixie-chicks-lead-singer.html><span>←</span><span>Natalie Maines Pics See Photos Of The Dixie Chicks Lead Singer Hollywood Life</span></a>
