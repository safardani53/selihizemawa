Sami, 17, looked like she inherited her looks from both her mom&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Denise Richards</a>,&nbsp;</strong>50, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Charlie Sheen,&nbsp;</strong></a>56. She’s totally a mix of both of her parents with features resembling both the Starship Troopers actress and Spin City star. She posted a series of nine new photos to her Instagram, where showed off a bright pink outfit that perfectly matched her dyed hair, on Tuesday February 1.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Other than the pink dress, which had a fuzzy, feathered top, Sami accessorized with a pair of thin-hooped earrings. She showed a few different looks, including herself gazing into a mirror. She also posted a couple of shots where she was lying down on a couch, showing off a few of her tattoos. The final pictures showed her in silhouette at sunset, by a gorgeous ocean view. She captioned the set simply, with just a love letter emoji.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The pink outfit perfectly matched Sami’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pink hair,</a> which she debuted in December, after moving back in with her dad. While it’s not the same shade as bubblegum pink as she first showed, Sami still definitely embraced a “pretty in pink” vibe for the photos. When she first showed off the hair makeover, she simply captioned the pictures with “she’s back.” That same month Sami also got a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>series of tattoos,</a> including a French phrase, a Radiohead lyric, and what’s likely a lucky number (11:11).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sami-sheen-pink-dress-mega-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The dyed hair and new ink came following her mom and dad’s long custody battle, which ended when a court decided that Charlie didn’t have to<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> pay child support anymore.</a> Sami is the elder of Charlie and Denise’s daughters from their four year marriage from 2002 to 2006. Their younger daughter is named <strong>Lola, </strong>16. Shortly after the decision, Sami also made the choice to move in with her dad. At the end of 2021, Sami capped off the year with a video <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>montage looking back</a> before starting 2022. She said that it was “a very lovely year,” in her Instagram caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49sZqyZnZ56tLTEnqVmqJmjuG671K2doqxdmLWivsuinGaclaO2tLGMq6CcoJGnsbR5y6impGWRobassYypn6isn6h8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./manish-dayal-wife-wedding-married-html.html><span>←</span><span>Manish Dayal &amp;amp; Wife Married Life Status!
