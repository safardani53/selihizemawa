He can do that just fine on his own.</p><p>Now, he’s ignited a firestorm feud with his baby mama, Sarah Rodriguez.</p><p>Vieth’s relationship with Rodriguez has been over for ages, but they’ll always be connected by their daughter, Ava.</p><p>But for whatever reason, Ryan has chosen to antagonize the mother of <a href=#>Tamra Judge’s only grandchild</a>.</p><p>They’ve had their spats in the past.</p><p>Actually, <a href=#>Ryan was arrested for domestic violence</a> in 2015, though the charges were eventually dropped … so it sounds like things have gotten a lot worse than spats.</p><p>And they’ve feuded on Instagram after their split.</p><p>This time, things are starting off with what we only wish were a promo for Amazon’s upcoming billion-dollar Lord of the Rings series.</p><p>“Anyone want to buy my old wedding ring, I have no need for this,” he writes.</p><p>As you can imagine, this was interpreted by many as a transparent attempt to antagonize and malign his ex.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>He told a follower “sold!” after the follower offered him $5 for it.</p><p>He would later go on to explain: “Just figured I’d post something interesting today.” He also reminded followers that he and Sarah never actually married.</p><p>Which is not really an explanation.</p><p>Would you care to guess how well-received his post was by his ex?</p><p>Sarah Jane Rodriguez did not mince words.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“Ryan wants to officially announce that he is looking for his next Instagram victim!!”</p><p>Oh wow!</p><p>She then proceeds to warn others away from repeating her past mistakes.</p><p>“As soon as he is done pretending he is something he is not and sucking you in.”</p><p>That’s ominous. And there’s a tag to go with that sense of foreboding.</p><p>“It will be too late. #beware”</p><p>Rodriguez explains herself:</p><p>“I have been working my ass off to make things good for Ava.”</p><p>Of course she has. She’s her mom.</p><p>“But this is not ok to publicly humiliate someone like this.”</p><p>Like everyone else, she interpreted the wedding ring post as a slight against her.</p><p>“No one will ever know the sacrifices I made for this person only to be s–t on over and over.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In the past, Rodriguez has opened up about her feuds with Ryan by sharing the sorts of messages that he sends her, as she did with this image last November.</p><p>(Yikes)</p><p>Rodriguez later deleted her post decrying Vieth’s&nbsp;“wedding ring” auction, and shared a message that reads:</p><p>“When you have a bad day, a really bad day, try to treat the world better than it treated you.”</p><p>She added her own caption to that sage advice, writing:</p><p>“Okay, let’s start over.”</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>21 Best Tamra Barney Quotes</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>Sometimes, that’s the best choice that a person can make.</p><p>We do have to wonder, however, if Tamra Judge is going to work this conflict into her own life.</p><p>In the past, Rodriguez has accused Vieth of relying heavily upon his mother for emotional support.
