I Feel Like a Woman</li><li>That Don't Impress Me Much</li><li>The Woman in Me</li><li>Come On Over</li></ul><h2>Is Shania Twain married?</h2><p>Shania has been married twice.</p><p>Her first marriage to Mutt Lange&nbsp;broke down when he left her for her best friend, Marie-Anne Thiebaud.</p><p>Speaking to The Sun she said: “I thought that marriage was forever. I really, really believed that. I thought, ‘I’m safe. This creative relationship is forever.' And I really counted on that.</p><p>“I never even considered that it would ever be different. I was committed and that would be the rest of my life. I was sure of that.</p><p>“So when that fell away, the marriage fell away, the friendship falls away with that, and every part of that falls away.

It’s a necessity. But you’re still lucky if you have it, so you can’t count on it.</p><p>“And I guess in that sense, that’s where my survival instincts come in.</p><p>“If I had never found love again, I’m not going to lay down and die. But I’m very lucky that I did.</p><p>“And that of course re-energizes all of the inspiration that any creative person needs. Falling in and out of love is always an inspiration to be creative, for me.”</p><h2>What is Shania Twain's net worth?</h2><p><a href=#>Shania</a>'s net worth is estimated to be nearly $400million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p>The Queen of Country Pop&nbsp;was inducted into&nbsp;Canada's Walk of Fame in 2003 and later received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011.</p><p>She has won a total of five Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, 11 Billboard Music Awards and 27 BMI Songwriter awards.</p><h2>What condition does Shania Twain have?</h2><p>Shania was left unable to sing for several years after she was diagnosed with Lyme disease due to a bite from an infected tick while horseback riding in Norfolk, Virginia in 2003.</p><p>The infection caused&nbsp;nerve damage to her vocal cords which led to her losing her voice.</p><p>Over the years Shania has had<a href=#> several throat surgeries</a> as well as taking time out from performing.</p><p>However, she is now able to sing again and had taken to the stage since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htYWiGc3%2BWaK6hp12ewG6%2Fx5qlopldqcSitc1mpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./denise-richards-people-want-me-dead-over-my-husbands-work.html><span>←</span><span>What Does He Do?
