Unfortunately, that is all the information regarding his family or early life.</p><p>Our team was able to find intel on his educational background. To illustrate, Erik went to Brown University to obtain his undergraduate degree.</p><p>During his time at Brown, Kuselias became an all-state baseball player. Additionally, he played with future MLB All-Stars like Brad Ausmus, Mo Vaughn, and Jeff Bagwell.</p><p>Besides that, the Connecticut native attended the University of Michigan Law School and Columbia University’s School of Journalism for his higher education. Likewise, in 1988, Erik took up a Ph.D. program.</p><h3>MENSA</h3><p>Many might find it unbelievable, but Erik Kuselias is a member of MENSA; he is not only brimming with journalism knowledge but also mathematically talented. For those unfamiliar, MENSA is a non-profit organization comprised of people with high IQs.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nick Wright Wife Danielle Wright: Bio, Kids & Net Worth >></strong></a></p><p>Everyone within this organization has scored more than 98 percentile on their standard supervised IQ test. Not to mention, many countries hold significant events called the Annual Gathering(AG).</p><h2>Erik Kuselias | Early Career</h2><p>Erik started his career with the legal firm Goldblatt, Kuselias & Rashba, P.C., where he handled many arbitration cases. But, after working for several years, Kuselias took a complete U-turn and decided to try his luck in the media world.</p><p>Now a renowned name in the networking world, Erik’s journey in law started way back in college. Subsequently, Erik debuted with the show titled “The Sports Brother” with his brother Chris in 2003. The show aired every week for an hour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/erik-003.jpg><p>Similarly, the show was such a success that ESPN hired the Kuselias brothers to become an afternoon drive-time program. Also, in 2005, it was rebranded as “The Erik Kuselias show” and became the fastest-growing sports talk show on radio.</p><p>But, by 2007, both siblings left the show, which forced the producers to change it to “SportsBash.”</p><p>Thus, after leaving the show in 2007, Kuselias joined NASCAR Now, Emmy nominated show 2007. Sadly, Erik’s stay lasted only a year as he was replaced by Nicole Manske for the 2008 NASCAR season.</p><p>After that, he worked for ESPN Radio and appeared on “Mike and Mike in the Morning” as a substitute for the main hosts. Additionally, he also hosted “Fantasy Football Now” which is an Emmy Award-winning show.</p><h3>Golf Channel</h3><p>On January 3, 2011, Erik started co-hosting Morning Drive on Golf Channel. Besides that, he also appeared as a studio host of the Stanley Cup Playoffs during CNBC’s coverage.</p><p>Likewise, Kuselias’ performances were so impressive that Golf Channel’s parent company, NBC Sports, hired him to work for them. Moving onto his last days, Erik hosted a morning drive show for Genesis Communications in Florida until 2016.</p><p>Since early 2018, Erik has worked at CBS Sports as a host for “Sportsline” and CBS Sports HQ.</p><p>Moreover, his show goes live on Sports Talk 1040 The Team in Tampa, WMOP in Ocala, WGGG in Gainesville, and Sports Talk 1080 The Team in Orlando.</p><p>Apart from that, Kuselias also hosts a News Talk Radio Show on AM 1060 News in Melbourne-Cocoa Beach and AM 820 News in Tampa.</p><h3>NBC Sports and Erik Kuselias&nbsp;</h3><p>Back when he was working with NBC Sports, Kuselias was once fired due to his ulterior deal and motive. In addition, NBC canned the Pro Football Talk Live host when he tried to land his then-wife, Holly, into a more significant value.</p><p>To illustrate, Fox Sports has been interested in Sonders for quite a long time. Thus, taking the opportunity, Kuselias tried to offer him and his wife a “package deal” to Fox Sports.</p><p></p><p>However, Fox Sports denied the offer, and he was again back to NBC to make a new deal. Indeed, NBC wasn’t happy with the ongoing stuff and the demands Kuselias presented in the contract.&nbsp;</p><p>That is how they ended up firing him from the team. All in all, to make things good, Kuselias only tangled the issue more.&nbsp;</p><h2>How old is Kuselias? Body Measurements & Nationality</h2><p>Regrettably, Erik has not revealed his date of birth as of yet. Hence, we cannot provide you with his exact age. But, judging from his pictures, Kuselias looks like he is in his mid-50s.</p><p>Erik stands at 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 65 kg. Moreover, he has thick black hair and dark brown eyes to compliment it.</p><p>And about his nationality, Kuselias was born in Hamden, a town in New Haven County, Connecticut. As a result, Erik is American by nationality, while his ethnicity happens to be white.</p><h2>Erik Kuselias | Net Worth, Salary, and Earnings</h2><p>Erik has been working as a tv and radio host for nearly 15 years. During those 15 years, he worked for elite sports media corporations like ESPN, Golf Channel, and CNBC. As a result, Kuselias stands on a humongous net worth of <strong>$6.5 million</strong>.</p><p>Talking about his salary, Erik earns $56,000 per year working as a morning drive Sports Radio show host for Genesis Communications. Unfortunately, the wages of his previous jobs have not been revealed yet.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ashton Meem Bio: Russell Wilson, Net Worth & Wedding >></strong></a></p><p>In addition to that, Erik has not disclosed his total earnings as of now. Also, his physical assets and other splurges have been kept secret.</p><h2>Is Erik Kuselias still married? Why did Holly Sonders get divorced?</h2><p>No matter who they are, the public is always interested in the dating life of celebrities. Erik is undoubtedly no exception. Sadly, Kuselias split up with his wife, <a href=# rel=noopener>Holly Sonders</a>, back in 2017. Moreover, the couple had been married for five years. Together, they have one son, Troy.</p><p>The two lovebirds met for the first time while working at the Golf Channel. Holly was considered the best college golf player then, but her growth was cut short due to an injury. Despite that, she was rated as one of the most attractive golfers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/erik-002.jpg><p>Talking about Holly, just like her ex, she is also a famous sportscaster who has worked for Golf Channel and ESPN.</p><p>But, somewhere around 2016, Sonders caught Erik with Stephania Bell. Consequently, Holly filed for divorce, and they eventually got separated a year later.</p><p>Talking about his present days, interestingly, Kuselias is currently dating Stephania. Yes, folks, she is the same girl Erik was caught red-handed.</p><p>Well, it is Kuselias’ life, and he can do whatever he wants now that he’s single.</p><h3>Holly is not his first wife!</h3><p>Despite their oh-sweet-romance, Holly Sanders is not the first woman who tied the knot with Erik. Holly is Erik’s second wife following his unsuccessful marriage with Kristen Kuselias.</p><p>Following on the matter, the 57 years old dated his former wife Kristen for a long time before making it official in 2010. They were married for almost a decade, from 2001 to 2010.</p><p>However, their marriage did not last long, and the duo did not take long to part ways. But still, to this date, the reason behind their divorce has not been disclosed to the public.</p><p>Also, Kristen has strayed far from the media and their questionable remarks regarding her relationship with Erik.</p><p>Likewise, Erik has three children from his two marriages. He has two sons named Erik and Troy and a daughter named Jenna. But they do not appear much in public or on social media.</p><h3>Controversies and Suspension</h3><p>It is not a new matter that Emmy winner Erik was caught having an affair with another ESPN reporter, Stephania Bell.</p><p>Well, things did not go well with him and the network. Right after the controversy, Erik was removed from ESPN.</p><p>It was not the only reason behind his suspension. One of the female employees filed sexual allegations that caused him to lose his job.</p><p>During the Super Bowl Monday night football party, Kuselias drunkenly and very graphically harassed the said team member, verbally using derogatory terms.</p><h2>Erik Kuselias | Social Media Presence</h2><p>Like any other celebrity, Erik is also active on social media, especially <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. In his social media handle, Kuselias mainly advises on college football picks and fantasy football.</p><p>According to sources, the said sportscaster has not been active in his account quite often. The same is the case with his Facebook accounts, which are nowhere to be found now.</p><p>Likewise, Erik Kuselias also doesn’t have a profile on Linked In.</p><p>Here is Erik’s recent tweet!</p><p>Moreover, this has led the fans to believe Erik might be isolating himself from the public. Also, he might want to avoid any issues regarding his failed marriages and sexual allegations.</p><p><strong>While you are at it, make sure to check this article</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Alan Jouban Bio: UFC, Model, Awards, Family & Net Worth >></strong></a></p><h2>Erik Kuselias | FAQs</h2><h3>When did Erik Kuselias get engaged to Holly Sonders?</h3><p>Erik Kuselias got engaged to <a href=#>Holly Sonders</a> in May 2012, and he already had a son in 2006.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCx0aKiZqOlqLKttcCsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-chandler-smith-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Chandler Smith Dating Now</span></a>
