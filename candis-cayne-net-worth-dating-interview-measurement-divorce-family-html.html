Her parents, Gary and Patricia, were both teachers at Waldorf School.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr>There was something ‘different’ about her since her childhood. Those differences made her a target for school bullies. She was taunted from mean ‘gay’ jibes from an early age as well as for ‘being the most feminine person in the class.’ <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>Her parents held her a year back in 8th grade as they worried about her well-being.
