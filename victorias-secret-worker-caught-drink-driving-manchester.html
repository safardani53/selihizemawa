The legal limit is 35mg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000531975448.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000531975104.jpg><p>At Manchester magistrates court Leadbeater pleaded guilty to drink driving and was banned from driving for 12 months.</p><p>The incident occurred when her Mustang was seen travelling along Chester Road.</p><p>Nicola Durham, prosecuting, said: "The defendant came to the police's attention after a CCTV operator highlighting concerns and notified them.</p><p>"They then located the vehicle and spoke to the defendant and came to the opinion that she had indeed consumed alcohol. A road side breathalyser reading in relation to that was 68mg but clearly that’s not the eventual reading and she was found to be 51mg at the police station.</p><p>"The defendant was off balance when she got out the car but there was nothing in relation to her actual driving. She has no previous convictions."</p><p>In mitigation for Leadbeater, Ashley Barnes, told the judge: "The reading of 51mg is in the lower end of the spectrum but it still comes as an enormous surprise to her - although she accepts the reading.</p><p>"You will have read she was slightly unsteady on her feet. She was driving in sliders which you wear on the beach normally.</p><p>"She had been out somewhere nice wearing nice shoes and took them off not as she did not want to drive in those nice shoes. So far as any loss of balance that would be the main reason."</p><p>Mr Barnes added: "Her income monthly will go because she lives north of Bolton and she has a job in the Trafford Centre. It won’t be economically viable for her to get there and keep the job."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in news</h2></p><p>Sentencing, Deputy District Judge Alexandra Simmonds told Leadbeater: "You pleaded guilty to driving having consumed too much alcohol on the day in question.</p><p>"Police where made aware of your presence by an operator of CCTV who said something they had seen made them concerned.</p><p>"Police arrived and you got out and were entirely cooperative but you had had too much to drink and were over the limit. Nobody has provided any evidence to show your driving was impaired and you have no previous convictions for driving or anything else."</p><p>Leadbeater was also fined £360 and was ordered to pay £436 in costs and surcharges.</p><p>She was also offered a chance to attend a drink driving rehabilitation course to reduce the length of her ban.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn1ygpFraGtnpp6wtbvRopisZaOasLOx02auqKqbmr9ur8CunqGsXZm%2FqrrKZpuroaaeu6h5zJqlnKCVqMGmvo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./realise-mcdonalds-logo-colour-scheme-psychology.html><span>←</span><span>People are only just realising why the McDonald's logo is red and yellow and their minds are blown</span></a>
