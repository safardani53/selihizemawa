People had never expected him to be a wolf in sheep’s clothing, but the truth is stranger than fiction.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past month, two of Hacmon’s ex-girlfriends, Daphney and Mellisa, accused him of molesting them. Daphney, whose Instagram handle is @ms.mercury, accused him of stealthing, raping, and emotionally abusing&nbsp;her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hacmon responded to his ex’s claims&nbsp;and tried to debunk them. He released a statement and a couple of texts between him and Daphney, but unfortunately, it did not do him any favor.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, it did not help that Trisha Paytas, his fiancée, released text messages&nbsp;between them and Ethan and Hila Klein&nbsp;on September 13, 2021. Paytas exposed themselves&nbsp;with the texts since it revealed that the Kleins stood alongside the victims.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>Similarly, Hila also urged her brother and Paytas to take accountability for their actions. After Daphney dropped the bomb of stealthing, she had been silent for a while.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But not anymore. On the night of September 18, 2021, Daphney went on Instagram live via @ms.mercury and talked about her allegations against Hacmon.&nbsp;</p><h2>Daphney aka @ms.mercury's Instagram Live</h2><p>Daphney revealed she was stoned but still confessed she could still talk about the situation at hand. She started by clarifying the timeline between her and Moses.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair met only once, but the date is contradicting and confusing. Daphney mentioned that they met on February 14, but previously she said they met on February 15.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Regardless of the date, the duo&nbsp;got intimate twice, which Hacmon dubbed as a hookup. Daphney was offended by that label, since their relationship meant a lot to her.&nbsp;</p><p>She confessed Hacmon knew a lot about her and her past, so she would have never gotten intimate with him if it was just for a “hookup.” Then, Daphney got more into details about their physical relationship and said she saw Hacmon stealthing.&nbsp;</p><p>She asked him to stop and did not consent to remove the condom, but her ex&nbsp;did not listen to her and continued. This is why Daphney emphasized Hacmon had raped her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She regretted sleeping with him, primarily because of what he did. Daphney had put a lot of trust in Hacmon, and he was the second person she ever got intimate with.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, Hacmon broke that trust and abused her physically and mentally. Daphney also talked about the Kleins. She tried reaching out to both Hila and Ethan via mail, but neither responded to her.&nbsp;</p><p>However, she saw the text messages revealed by Paytas and was glad that Kleins believed in her. Daphney also opened up that she was not revealing much into details at the moment because of her respect for Hila.&nbsp;</p><p>But that did not mean that Daphney would stay silent. On the contrary, she said she had nothing to hide and had remained silent for a very long time before. Now, she is ready to tackle anything that comes her way.</p><p>Daphney also vented about Paytas calling her a bully and how they were hypocritical. No matter how controversial Paytas is, they have always stood beside victims of abuse and molestation.&nbsp;</p><p>But when it came to Daphney, they were calling names and body-shaming her. However, Daphney is not scared of anyone anymore and will not stop telling her story.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout her Instagram Live, Daphney hinted about the lawsuit and suing&nbsp;Hacmon. Unfortunately, stealthing is not recognized as a crime in California as of today.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Therefore, she asked her fans and followers to get #AB453 trending on Twitter to bring attention to stealthing so that Hacmon could finally get sued and arrested.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is AB-453?</h2><p>California Assembly Bill 453, commonly known as AB-453, is new legislation that is soon to be made law in California. The law addresses stealthing — the act of removing condoms secretly without the consent of the partner.</p><p>In the United States, there are presently no laws that specifically address&nbsp;stealthing. California may become the first state in the United States to make stealthing a civil offense, but not a crime.</p><p>AB-453, introduced by California Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens), would classify nonconsensual condom removal or stealthing as a form of sexual violence.</p><p>Additionally, under the state’s civil law, AB-453 would allow a victim to file a claim for emotional and bodily damages. Currently, California is moving to outlaw stealthing since it was approved unanimously on September 7, 2021.</p><p>Now, only the signature of Gavin Newsom, the Governor of California, is left. He has until October 10, 2021, to sign it into law. After that, stealthing will officially be recognized as a civil offense in California.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWfqLK0eceamqannmK5osPSrqCtZZeev62y0aKcp5xdqMGmrcutn6Kml2O1tbnL</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-g-avildsen-19351221-html.html><span>←</span><span>John G.
