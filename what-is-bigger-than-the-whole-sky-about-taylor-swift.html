What that specific loss happens to be, however, is left to interpretation.</p><p>The first verse begins: "No words appear before me in the aftermath / Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears / Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness / 'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Whatever loss Taylor experienced was over something fleeting and short-lived — but nevertheless gut-wrenching. The chorus lyrics read:</p><p>"Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye / You were bigger than the whole sky / You were more than just a short time / And I've got a lot to pine about / I've got a lot to live without / I'm never gonna meet / What could've been, would've been / What should've been you / What could've been, would've been you."</p><p>In the second verse, the lyrics express a sense of guilt ("Did some force take you because I didn't pray?"). They also indicate a death of sorts ("Did some bird flap its wings over Asia?") and shattered dreams ("Every single thing to come has turned into ashes").</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After picking themselves off the floor from ugly-crying, fans took to Twitter to express their utter devastation over "Bigger Than the Whole Sky."
