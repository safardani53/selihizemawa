She posted a video of her looking in her mailbox for her Season 8 contract for Married to Medicine, but the contract was nowhere to be found. "I had heard that Married to Medicine contracts came out, but mine is not in the mail," she said.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlanta Black Star</a> in June of 2020, Mariah confirmed she had still not received her contract and seemed to imply that she had not been given any information about why she had been excluded from the cast. "I’m typically the last person to know things about Married to Medicine unfortunately, and I’m hoping that that changes real soon," she said. "It’s not the way that it’s supposed to be."</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mariah announced she was going to file a lawsuit against Bravo.</h2><p>After Mariah was not included in Season 8 of the show, she announced that she intended to file a lawsuit against Bravo. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All About the Tea</a>, the lawsuit accused the network and its producers of "breach of contract, breach of joint venture agreement, failure to prevent harassment, and retaliation."</p><p>In May of 2022, Mariah appeared on an episode of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality With the King podcast</a> and gave an update regarding the lawsuit. She ended up not moving forward with it but seems to feel as though things worked out for the best anyway. "Certain things didn’t materialize because they didn’t have to," she said. "It worked itself out. I know God worked it out. When they say make your enemy your footstool, they come to you. So things were tied up and worked out in a beautiful way. It kind of happened like that and that was a blessing. But it was still hard. So I may not physically have filed a lawsuit, but it’s not to say I wasn’t on that track."</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#married2med</a> Mariah will forever be missed on this show!!!!
