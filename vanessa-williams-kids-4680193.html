First rising to stardom in 1984 as the first Black woman to win the Miss America crown, Vanessa went on to build a storied career on the stage and screen. Starring in Broadway productions like Kiss of the Spider Woman and Into the Woods, the latter of which won her a Tony Award, Vanessa established her one-of-a-kind talent, and will even return to the stage in POTUS.&nbsp;Vanessa has also gained acclaim on the small screen, winning an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emmy Award</a> in 2007 for her role on&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ugly Betty</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/vanessa-williams-duaghters-nyfw-ss-01-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Through the many phases of her career, Vanessa has also managed to raise a beautiful family, welcoming her first child when she was 24. The star even treated her three gorgeous daughters to a front row seat at the Pamella Roland Show at New York Fashion Week. The ladies were dressed to impress, and the only thing missing was Vanessa’s son!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In an as-told-to essay for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Glamour</a>, Vanessa opened up about how decades of being a mom have shaped her as a person. “I’ve been a mother so long that&nbsp;it’s hard to remember what my life was like before then,” she revealed, “but parenthood has never felt like a burden: It strengthened my outlook on life and made me more ambitious in my career.” Learn more about the four children Vanessa calls her own, below!</p><h2><span><span>Melanie Hervey</span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vanessa-William-kids-shutter-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Vanessa welcomed her eldest daughter, Melanie, in 1987, with her first husband <strong>Ramon Hervey II. </strong>Ramon was one of Vanessa’s first managers and was 10 years her senior at the time they wed. Though Ramon and Vanessa would go on to divorce in 1997, they welcomed two daughters and a son first: Melanie, Jillian, and Devin.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Melanie, who remains largely out of the public eye, worked in the fashion business for nearly a decade before leaving it behind to become a teacher. Though Melanie previously worked on shows like E! True Hollywood Story and&nbsp;Dealin With Idiots, for the most part, Melanie has chosen to build a life outside the Hollywood eye.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>By the looks of her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, Melanie has become enamored with yoga! The beauty shared several videos of herself tackling the most difficult poses!</p><h2><span><span>Jillian Hervey</span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vanessa-William-kids-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Vanessa’s second daughter, Jillian, was born in 1989, and has gone on to establish her own voice in Hollywood…quite literally! As the lead singer of R&B duo Lion Babe, Jillian has brought her smooth and soulful croon to three albums and has worked with rappers like <strong>Busta Rhymes</strong> and <strong>Childish Gambino</strong> (better known to some as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Donald Glover</strong></a>.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Welcoming more than just new singles, Jillian also recently had her first child, who she shares with Lion Babe counterpart, producer <strong>Lucas Goodman</strong>. In light of the big news, Vanessa couldn’t resist taking to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to share the excitement and joy she felt watching her daughter enter motherhood, and for becoming a grandmother herself. Captioning a photo of herself beaming as she held her hand to Jillian’s belly, Vanessa <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a>: “I’m always here to support, advise and babysit at any moment.” She also sweetly thanked Lucas in the caption, who “has been by Jillian’s side since the beginning with support, love, and endless creativity.”</p><h2><span><span>Devin Hervey</span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vanessa-William-kids-shutter-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Vanessa welcomed her one and only son in 1993. Though he acted alongside his mom in the 2000 romantic historical drama The Courage of Love, other than that Devin has not chosen a life of celebrity, and instead reportedly works at a high fashion outlet in Los Angeles. It appears he has no active Instagram at this time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Though Devin himself may lead a private life, Vanessa has shared just how much he means to her in many ways. She even revealed an adorable moment from Devin’s childhood in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Black Voices</a>, sharing: “I love when the kids make things and prepare meals. I used to love when they were young and they’d make the menu and prepare the brunch for me and wake me up with some handicraft note. And one time my son learned ‘You are My Sunshine’ and he waited until Mother’s Day morning [to sing it]. So the&nbsp;things that are not bought are my favorites.”</p><h2><span><span>Sasha Fox&nbsp;</span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vanessa-William-kids-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Vanessa shares youngest daughter <strong>Sasha Fox</strong> with second husband and NBA player <strong>Rick Fox</strong>, who she wed in 1999. After welcoming Sasha in 2000, Rick and Vanessa would go on to divorce in 2005, with Vanessa in part <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>citing</a> the high pressure of her being in show business and him managing the NBA.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Sasha has followed in her mom’s footsteps and begun to build a burgeoning career as a model and actress. After performing in A Diva Xmas Carol and Justice for All with Judge Cristina Perez, Sasha also found herself in the pages of Vogue modeling for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Serena Williams</strong></a>‘ line ‘Serena.’</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Although Sasha is clearly as busy as her mom once was building a career, she’s still finding time to be a young adult, and is currently receiving her degree from Chapman University in Orange, California. She also loves to keep her fans posted on her activities to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, including adorable snaps with her NBA legend father.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9WapZ6ro5Z6uLXLpaCapaNiuKqw0mZrb3BgZoZ0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marshmello-deadmau5-beef-html.html><span>←</span><span>Marshmello Might Be over Deadmau5 Beef but Deadmau5 Isnt</span></a>
