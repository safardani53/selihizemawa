He was a mile back before charging up the hill and closed with every stride. The second that day then franked the form by beating today’s main danger Calico last month so the race looks decent.</p><p>Race 2: THUNDER ROCK 1750</p><p>was far from disgraced in Grade 1 company last season, including in the Brown Advisory at the Festival. He was then a good second at Ayr before returning with an impressive success over this trip at Carlisle last month. He can still make the odd error but he has a big engine and he can strike from just 4lb higher than his last winning mark.</p><p>Race 3: BROADWAY BOY 1750</p><p>has had just three runs over fences and already looks a hot prospect. He kicked off with an easy win at Worcester for Nigel Twiston-Davies before he chased home Flooring Porter. He improved on that when taking a Listed prize here by 20 lengths, jumping like a real natural. He drops back to handicap level here off a nice weight with more to come over this slightly longer trip.</p><p>Race 4: GIN COCO 1250</p><p>clocked a big personal best when beating a former County Hurdle winner at Ascot last time. He didn’t get the best of runs before clearing right away after the second-last. That was impressive and a 4lb rise in the weights seems more than fair.</p><p>Race 5: CADELL 750</p><p>looks a certain improver over this longer distance. He tried to come from too far back at Kelso latest and was running on at the finsh. He’ll appreciate this test.</p><p>Race 6: TWOSHOTSOFTEQUILA 750</p><p>scored the last time he ran on Town Moor in March and has been knocking on the door this season. He’s been beaten by a total of a length in two starts at Carlisle and Catterick and champion jockey Brian Hughes takes over. He can galvanise this six-year-old who looks on a fair mark.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Race 7: THEATRE GLORY 1250</p><p>has her sights lowered here by Nicky Henderson and she has enough class to win under a big weight over an ideal trip. She looked short of a run when third in an Ascot Grade 2 on comeback and she won a Listed contest at Warwick earlier this year.</p><h4 class=has-text-align-center id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
