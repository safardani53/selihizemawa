Hollywood’s most celebrated actors and actresses aren’t always the most decorated.</p><p>Despite having amassed notoriety and critical acclaim, there are plenty of stars who come up short in the awards department — at least as far as the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences is concerned.</p><p><a href=#><strong>John Travolta</strong></a>, for instance, has been nominated twice but came up short of a win both times, as did his Pulp Fiction costar <a href=#><strong>Samuel L. Jackson</strong></a>, who was nominated in one category for the film in 1994. However, the latter became a winner in March 2022 with an honorary Oscar presented by <a href=#><strong>Denzel Washington</strong> </a>at the Governor’s Awards days before the televised ceremony.</p><p>“I guarantee you, this this is going to be cherished,” Jackson told the audience.</p><p>Other beloved celebs, including <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a>, have never even had the honor of being recognized by the prestigious group, with no nominations to their names.</p><p>While some stars keep quiet about their snubs, others are more outspoken. In 2019, <a href=#><strong>Jim Carrey</strong></a> admitted that he has no interest in the campaign strategy that coincides with awards season.</p><p>“There’s a lot of monkey business that goes on around awards,” Carrey, who’s scored two Golden Globes throughout his career but is still without a single Oscar nomination, told <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>. “[It’s a] gigantic clusterf–k. … If you don’t show up to a certain dinner, you screw your chances and all those things. I’ve never been real good at playing that game.”</p><p>The Liar Liar actor continued, “The only time I’ve ever felt a twinge of something about an award or not getting nominated is whenever people tell me I should be. Like, really? Should I be disgruntled? I had a wonderful time and I met a bunch of people. … Isn’t that enough?”</p><p>Though Carrey hasn’t been nominated for the most prestigious trophies in Hollywood, <a href=#><strong>Glenn Close</strong></a> has been just shy of an Oscar more than once. Before earning her <a href=#>eighth nomination</a> from the Academy in March 2021, the Hillbilly Elegy actress sat down for a <a href=#>virtual chat</a> with <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a> — who couldn’t believe Close didn’t have an Oscar to her name.</p><p>“What can we do to get you an Oscar?” the SNL star asked in the January 2021 <a href=#>Variety</a> interview. “We have to get the internet to help because you deserve seven!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Close, however, wasn’t too concerned. “Is it better to be wheeled out in a wheelchair and get the lifetime achievement award?” she teased at the time. “You don’t have to make a speech. It’s beyond me. I don’t know what to say about that. I just have to keep doing what’s good. You’re <a href=#>fulfilled by your work</a>, and that’s the process to me. It’s what feeds my soul, but it really is nice when other people like it. It might be cool to never get one.”</p><p>Scroll through to find out who else is still waiting on their gold statues below!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowaK%2B0mauoaddna63sYynnK%2BdomLEsLqMmqVmp6OYrrN5kWlobWplZ3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./saltburn-house-movie-northamptonshire-visit-lowick.html><span>←</span><span>Saltburn fans are travelling to Northamptonshire to visit the house in the controversial movie - her</span></a>
