The former Miss America has proudly shown her support for Democratic nominee, <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>, 68, but because of the publicity, haunting details of her allegedly checkered past have come to surface. In 2010,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Univision</a>&nbsp;reported that she mothered a child with&nbsp;<strong>Gerardo Álvarez-Vázquez</strong>, a drug lord correlated with&nbsp;the notorious Sinaloa cartel. Alicia has since denied the reports, claiming that he is not the father of her daughter<strong> Dinorah</strong>, who was born in 2008.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>[jwplatform jD6k1Q2N]</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Despite the original story coming&nbsp;from Spanish news reports years ago, the information has made it’s rounds once again. Gerardo&nbsp;allegedly went by the nickname&nbsp;“El Indio”or “El Chayán,” and was arrested in April 2010 and charged with running the Beltrán-Leyva narco-trafficking cartel. Yikes. Since then, Alicia has&nbsp;come forward to SLAM allegations that she had anything to do with him. She told People that she&nbsp;“did&nbsp;not have any relationship” with that man. She even came forward with the identity of her daughter’s father claiming, “he was very respectable businessman’ named&nbsp;<strong>Rafael Hernandez Linares</strong>.”</p><h3><a class=pmclinkcontent-post href=# rel=noopener>Hillary Clinton’s Celebrity Supporters —&nbsp;Check Out Pics Here</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Meanwhile, Alicia has become a prominent name, especially after being featured in Hillary’s ad about <strong>Donald Trump</strong> body-shaming women. Shortly after she won the Miss America title in&nbsp;1996, she was called “Miss Piggy” from the Republican nominee over her weight gain. On Aug. 19, she officially became a&nbsp;legal citizen, so she could&nbsp;cast her vote for Hillary.&nbsp;We’re hoping all the negativity surrounding her ends soon, especially for the benefit of her young daughter!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do YOU make of the latest news about Alicia?
