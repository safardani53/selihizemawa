still only halfway done, but that hasn’t stopped fans from speculating about how it will all end.</p><p>Episodes 6 and 7 will drop on December 26, the next two episodes on January 2, and the big finale on January 9.</p><p>Now that the show is in the middle of its season, many of the cast members have been active on social media and feeding their new followers plenty of content.</p><p>Fans think star Son Won-ik may have just accidentally given out a major clue as to who he ends up with on the show, though.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Netflix">Read More on Netflix</h2><p>He recently spent some quality time with Yu Si-eun in Paradise, where he revealed he’s a realtor for premium properties, but many fans don’t envision the two as a long-term pair.</p><p>Instead, viewers believe he and Choi Hye-seon will leave the show as a couple, and they think Won-ik has just given them a clue on Instagram.</p><p>Shortly after the new episodes of Single’s Inferno 3 dropped on <a href=#>Netflix</a> on Tuesday, the contestants joined together for a party to celebrate the show.</p><p>Won-ik shared a sweet video from the event with many of <a href=#>his co-stars</a>, but followers noticed he seemed to include an extra special moment with Hye-seon.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The video began with the real estate broker and a few of the other cast members all smiling at the camera, making funny faces, and waving.</p><p>Won-ik then shared a clip of some of the stars at a table enjoying drinks, treats, and each other’s company.</p><p>The room was decked out in pink, white, and red heart-shaped balloons to go with the dating and love themes of the reality show.</p><p>Then it was time for Won-ik to stop with the group shots and focus in on just one person: Hye-seon.</p><p>He filmed her as she showed off her now-long hair – after rocking a more cropped look on the show – and her fit figure in a body-hugging black dress.</p><p>As Won-ik recorded her, she was busy holding up her phone and recording him right back.</p><p>He then hopped into the view of his camera, so both he and Hye-seon were in the frame.</p><p>They both smiled and laughed, before taking turns to fully look at one another.</p><p>In the background, a remix version of the song Agora Hills continued to play, but fans insisted the lyrics, “I wanna show you off,” took on a whole new meaning during this portion.</p><p>The video wrapped up with six of the stars all waving to the camera, with Won-ik front and center, and Hye-seon right next to him.</p><p>Fans flooded the comments section to gush over how the two look “really good together” and that he seemed to be dropping clues.&nbsp;</p><p>One Instagram user theorized: “I think hyeseon and wonik endgame.”</p><p>A second agreed, writing: “I guess they'll leave the inferno together”</p><p>A third pointed out: “The song.. ‘I wanna show you off’ and he literally included a clip of hyeseon and him… IS IT A HINT THO?!</p><p>“I’m shipping these two so hard rn”</p><p>Other fans noticed Won-ik often reposted Instagram Stories featuring fan edits of him and Hyeseon and speculated this was because they ended up together.</p><p>“Living off the wonik hyeseon crumbs,” one fan wrote after reading about some of the clues fans pointed out.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>A second commented: “I’m the captain of the Woonik x Hyeseon ship”</p><p>Fans will have to wait until the Single's Inferno 3 finale releases on Netflix on January 9 to find out if their theory is correct.</p><img
