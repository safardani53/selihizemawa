<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Watch David Blaine Catch a Bullet in His Mouth</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Taking the phrase “bite the bullet” to a whole new level. <b><a href=#>David Blaine</a></b> pulled off his most dangerous and death-defying stunt yet when he shot himself and caught the bullet in his mouth — but it didn’t go exactly as planned.&nbsp;</p><p>In the hour-long ABC special <i>David Blaine: Beyond Magic,</i> which aired on Tuesday, November 15, the magician attached a string to a gun, which he used to pull the trigger and fire a bullet into a steel cup in his mouth.</p><p>As soon as the bullet hit the cup, the 43-year-old illusionist knew something was wrong. “There was a high-pitched ringing in my ears, and I felt an impact in the back of my throat and I was sure the bullet went right through my head and I was dead,” Blaine recounted during the special.</p><p>Luckily, it was just the shattering of his mouth guard, and he escaped with only a minor laceration. He was taken to the hospital for treatment, but despite the close call, he insists that he’ll continue to perform the trick on his upcoming tour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>As documented for a </span><a href=#><i>Rolling Stone</i></a><span> behind-the-scenes video, Blaine did a lot of preparation for the crazy maneuver. The illusionist had a friend shoot him multiple times in the chest with a handgun while Blaine wore a bulletproof vest with the impact plate removed. The purpose of the exercise was to teach him not to flinch when the gun went off.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“In order to catch a bullet, I need to get comfortable with this first,” he says in the <i>Rolling Stone </i>clip. “In order to figure out if I have the confidence to do it, I needed to get shot here a bunch of times so I understand, ‘Oh, it’s possible.’”</p><p>Blaine — who is also known for such stunts as hanging upside down in NYC’s Central Park for 60 hours and spending 44 days in a clear plastic box over London’s River Thames with no food — performed several other mind-blowing tricks to a celebrity audience during his magic special. In one memorable moment, <a href=#>he spit out live frogs into champagne glasses</a> and totally freaked out <b>Drake</b>, <b>Dave Chappelle</b>, <b>Stephen Curry</b> and <b>Jimmy Butler</b>.</p><p>During a <a href=#>Facebook Live </a>chat (conducted at Facebook Media Central) on Tuesday, Blaine further discussed his world tour. “It’s going to have everything that I’ve worked on my entire life including death-defying stunts, magic,” he said. “It will be like mini Ted talks all strung together, and it will start in an experimental magic way — small — and I’ll start to add more dangerous things to it as I start to feel comfortable with it.”</p><p><i>David Blaine: Beyond Magic</i> is available to stream on <a href=#>Hulu</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawmaSYtW6wwK%2BgnWWSoa6qusRmmpqsk516onnBrqOlnaRitq95x6KqZqWfqsGpedZtbGlwYG18</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashley-darby-cant-get-alimony-in-michael-darby-divorce-rhop-season-7-reunion-trailer.html><span>←</span><span>RHOP's Ashley Darby Says She Can't Get Alimony in Michael Darby Divorce</span></a>
