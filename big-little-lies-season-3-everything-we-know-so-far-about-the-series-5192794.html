Keep reading to see the potential release date, cast information, plot details and more.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>When Will ‘Big Little Lies’ Season 3 Premiere?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>During a Q&A at a Ladies Professional Golf Association event in November 2023, Nicole noted that she “loved” working on the famous HBO series and claimed that she was working on season 3.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I loved<i> Big Little Lies </i>because it sort of came along at a time in my life when I had my children, and I was thinking I was going to retire,” the <i>Undoing</i> alum said. “And then, this situation came along, where <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Reese Witherspoon</b></a> and I were able to produce that show and create that show. And then all of you watched it and made it a massive success. And we will be bringing you a third one, just FYI.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The only issue is that fans aren’t sure whether or not Nicole was implying that the entire cast had already begun filming. None of the other cast members — Reese, <b><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Shailene Woodley</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Laura Dern </a></b>and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Zoë Kravitz</b></a> — has confirmed if they’re on board with the third season. However, if the cast begins filming the series this year, a potential release date would be sometime in 2024 now that the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes have come to an end.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/big-little-lies-embed-1.jpg><h2>Who Is in the ‘Big Little Lies’ Season 3 Cast?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>As of now, only Nicole has confirmed that she would be a part of the season 3 cast. Previously, other actors expressed doubt that they would work on a third season. In fact, Zoe once said she “doubted” they would ever return to the <i>Big Little Lies</i> set.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I don’t think it is [returning],” the <i>Batman</i> actress explained in a 2022 TikTok video. “We talked about doing a season 3 a lot and, unfortunately, Jean-Marc Vallée, our incredible director, passed away this last year, and I just can’t imagine going on without him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Meryl Streep</b></a> also had a big impact on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season 2 of the show</a>, so fans are hoping she will return as well — especially after the way her and Nicole’s characters ended the season 2 finale.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>What Happened at the End of Season 2?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>At the end of season 2, Meryl’s character, Mary Louise, and Nicole’s Celeste faced off, and more details about Perry’s death were revealed (Perry is played by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Alexander Skarsgard</b></a>). It was revealed that Mary Louise lost control while driving her sons, which accidentally killed Perry’s brother. Celeste also hinted that Mary Louise had abused Perry emotionally and possibly physically, which could have caused him to become a domestic abuser. Mary Louise then had it out with Celeste at home, insisting that she never abused Perry.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The Monterey Five are also implied to have turned themselves in toward the end of the episode, as they approached the police station. This ending divided many viewers.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GinmakmanBrbGMpaCeq12osqK%2FzqdkbGWVq7KzxdOhoKefXayybrfNqK5mq59is6K%2BjJqZqK2kYsGpsYysnKuhlah6dn2Ya25ybF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./debbie-flores-narvaez-vegas-showgirl-is-missing.html><span>←</span><span>Debbie Flores-Narvaez, Vegas Showgirl, is Missing</span></a>
