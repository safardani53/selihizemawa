He addressed the squabble in an August 2015 interview with <i><a href=#>Esquire</a></i>, saying, “I got a call from my agent, saying, ‘Hey, I just got a call from Lionsgate. Damien told them he no longer thinks you’re creatively right for the project. He’s moving on without you.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Chazelle, 32, who directed Teller in 2014’s <i>Whiplash</i>, also discussed the last-minute change in a September 2016 interview. “The casting of this movie during the six years it took to get made went through lots of permutations, and it’s true there was a moment where Emma Watson and Miles Teller were doing it,” he told <i><a href=#>Uproxx</a></i>. “And neither of those casting things wound up lasting or working out.”</p><p>“But I loved working with [Teller] in <i>Whiplash</i>,” the filmmaker continued. “That’s why he and I started talking about doing this one together. And I think he’s an extraordinary actor.”</p><p>Teller claimed there were no hard feelings. “I’m a pretty strong believer that everything happens for a reason,” he told <i>Esquire</i>. “I’m happy Damien made the film he wanted to make. … I don’t get jealous of good reviews.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Watson, 26, meanwhile, began working on a different musical, the live-action adaptation of <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, which is set to hit theaters on March 17.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Producers eventually selected Stone, 28, and Gosling, 36, for the roles of Mia Dolan and Sebastian Wilder.
