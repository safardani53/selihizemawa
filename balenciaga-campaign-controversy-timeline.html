Some of the brand's infamous past decisions have included <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>putting heels on Crocs</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>selling destroyed sneakers for $1,850</a> and styling <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Kim Kardashian</a> in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>head-to-toe black bodysuit</a> at the 2021 Met Gala.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Recently, the brand turned heads after cutting ties with longtime collaborator and supporter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kanye West</a> after he wore a "White Lives Matter" shirt and publicly partook in harmful antisemitic rhetoric. But now, celebrities — like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Bella Hadid</a>, who modeled in the Garde-Robe campaign — are being called out to cut ties with the brand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about the Balenciaga scandal amid the $25 million lawsuit initiation.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nov-16-2022-balenciaga-launches-its-2022-gift-collection-holiday-campaign></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nov. 16, 2022: Balenciaga launches its 2022 'Gift Collection' holiday campaign</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>courtesy balenciaga</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The luxury fashion house published a campaign titled "Balenciaga Gift Shop" on Nov. 16 in support of its Spring/Summer 2023 collection. The launch featured two campaigns, both of which received backlash due to their controversial images.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first "gift collection" campaign, shot by award-winning National Geographic photographer Gabriele Galimberti, featured photos of children holding handbags that looked like teddy bears wearing leather harnesses and spiked collars with wine glasses near in some of the shots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The second was a Garde-Robe campaign, featuring an "office" theme (not shot by Galimberti), which included a photo with a page from a Supreme Court ruling of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>United States v. Williams</a> in the background. That ruling deemed the promotion of child pornography illegal and not protected under freedom of speech.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of Galimberti's most notable collections is called "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Toy Stories,</a>" which in part laid the foundation for the inspiration behind the holiday shoot. According to Insider, Balenciaga told Galimberti they wanted the "Gift Collection" to be shot in the same style, but <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>they'd provide the "punk" objects</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nov-23-2022-photographer-gabriele-galimberti-issues-a-statement-on-instagram></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nov. 23, 2022: Photographer Gabriele Galimberti issues a statement on Instagram</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amid the backlash, the campaign's photographer, Galimberti, issued a statement on Instagram. He claimed in part that he "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>was not entitled in whatsoever manner to neither chose</a> [sic] the products, nor the models, nor the combination of the same."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Galimberti added, "As a photographer, I was only and solely requested to lit the given scene, and take the shots according to my signature style. As usual for a commercial shooting, the direction of the campaign and the choice of the objects displayed are not in the hands of the photographer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He went on to emphasize how pedophilia searches on the web are "completely different" from the photos he shot, noting that those are "absolutely explicit in their awful content" and the accusations "distract from the real problem, and criminals."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In conclusion, Galimberti made sure to clarify that the campaign featuring the Supreme Court document <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>was not photographed by him</a>. "That one was taken in another set by other people and was falsely associated with my photos," he wrote on Instagram.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nov-24-2022-balenciaga-issues-its-first-statement-amid-backlash></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nov. 24, 2022: Balenciaga issues its first statement amid backlash</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Smith Collection/Gado/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Balenciaga received immediate backlash following the launch of their "Gift Collection" campaign from social media users accusing the company of sexualizing the children in the ads. The luxury fashion house issued a response roughly a week later, acknowledging the controversy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We sincerely apologize for any offense our holiday campaign may have caused.

We have immediately removed the campaign from all platforms," read a statement on Balenciaga's Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hours later, the brand issued a second statement acknowledging the Garde-Robe "office" campaign which featured the Supreme Court documents. "We apologize for displaying unsettling documents in our campaign," the statement read on the brand's Instagram story.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We take this matter very seriously and are taking legal action against the parties responsible for creating the set and including unapproved items for our Spring 23 campaign photo shoot.

North Six has collaborated with the brand in previous campaigns, while one of Jardins' recent gigs includes work on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Beyoncé's Renaissance album cover</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The legal document alleged that North Six and Jardins took part in "inexplicable acts and omissions" that were "malevolent or, at the very least, extraordinarily reckless."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Furthermore, Balenciaga claimed that the Supreme Court papers were placed in the campaign photographs without their knowledge and had led to false associations between Balenciaga and child pornography, the NYT noted.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nov-27-2022-kim-kardashian-condemns-balenciaga-on-twitter></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nov. 27, 2022: Kim Kardashian condemns Balenciaga on Twitter</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Theo Wargo/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kardashian broke her silence on the controversial teddy bear campaign and condemned the company in a lengthy thread on Twitter. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kardashians</a> star has been a frequent collaborator with the luxury brand, notably donning its looks at events such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the Met Gala in 2021</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have been quiet for the past few days, not because I haven't <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>been disgusted and outraged by the recent Balenciaga campaigns</a>," she began her statement.
