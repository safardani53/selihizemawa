It normalises name calling and negatively pointing out differences."</p><p>Carly, who herself wears glasses, said the subject is close to home as her daughter has fallen victim to cruel jibes.</p><p>The mum said: "She wears hearing aids and has been called four ears by an ignorant and nasty boy at a previous school. No doubt he coined the term from the four eyes name."</p><p>Sales worker Sara Sutton, who lives in Mornington, Victoria, said she was "shattered" to see the packaging, which opened old wounds from her past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/nintchdbpict000365118373.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/nintchdbpict000365118413.jpg><p>Sara, 36, said: "I loved the name Positively Perfect, then I saw four eye comment and felt shattered.

Why is it making a statement on who is perfect or not?</p><p>"It's unnecessary and derogatory with very little thought.

As a survivor of childhood bullying, I understand the pain of being bullied.</p><p>"In light of the recently discovered information and concerns, the World of EPI will further look into this matter with our partners in manufacturing and distribution."</p><p>The Sun Online has reached out to Target for further comment.</p><p>It's not the only doll to cause controversy.</p><p>Last year a mum was <a href=#>horrified when she bought a doll for daughter, two, only to find it makes "sexual" noises.</a></p><p>And another mum claims <a href=# rel=noopener>Argos doll "SWEARS" after daughter opened it on 2nd birthday.</a></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Mum's shock as she claims Argos doll swears instead of saying 'mama'</span><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More in parenting</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5NxbGtoZWV8rsHMrGSspJGierTAzqucZquVobmqusZmqqmdk6mupLjEZq6emaKeu6h5w6ijpatdm7y2voyesJ6rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-ripa-daughter-lola-consuelos-fit-figure-romper-vacation.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Ripa's daughter Lola Consuelos, 22, shows off fit figure in glittery purple romper on vacation</span></a>
