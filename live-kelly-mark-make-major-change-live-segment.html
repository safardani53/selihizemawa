That's called phubbing," Mark said.</p><p>Kelly fired back, stating her 'phubbing' was in response to numerous group emails that Mark neglects to answer.</p><p>"So, somebody has to answer these people."</p><p>Mark, attempting to downplay her actions, dismissed them as 'busy work.'</p><p>This comment led to an awkward pause, where Kelly looked at the audience, eliciting boos.</p><p>"Is that a bad term? 'Busy work?" Mark inquired, turning toward the jeering audience.</p><p>An unamused Kelly remained silent, her face etched in a frown, as Mark joked that their dog Lena was also engaged in 'busy work.'</p><h2>'SHUT IT!'</h2><p>Kelly, after taking a moment, offered Mark some unsolicited advice.</p><p>"You know, Mark," she said.</p><p>"As someone who has grown up with you. Literally grown up-."</p><p>"Yeah, we grew up together," Mark agreed.</p><p>"And as your attorney-," Kelly quipped, inducing laughter from the audience.</p><p>"I am going to encourage you to shut it!"</p><p>This led to Mark laughing uproariously.</p><p>"Because," Kelly continued, "nobody is a bigger offender than you."</p><p>"Really?" Mark asked, visibly surprised.</p><p>"You go to bed at night clutching your phone and the remote control," Kelly pointed out.</p><p>"I'm a man. That's what men do," Mark retorted.</p><p><strong>COSTLY MISTAKE</strong></p><p>It appears this wasn't the first occasion Kelly had to correct Mark on-air.</p><p>Previously, the couple had participated in a viewer trivia game named Brighten Your Day.</p><p>If the couple incorrectly guessed the true statement among two provided by the caller, the caller would win a mug.</p><p>Mark's former co-host, Ryan Seacrest, always aimed for the viewer to win, but Mark played strictly by the rules.</p><p>In a recent game, a caller named Susan presented two facts, with one being her affinity for wax museums and the other her encounter with Bob Newhart's statue in Chicago.</p><p>Mark guessed correctly but felt some remorse afterward.</p><p>"You just robbed her of a mug!" Kelly admonished, sitting upright.</p><p>Mark could only shrug and smirk.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Susan assured them it was fine, but Kelly wasn't convinced.</p><p>"It’s not OK! Susan, I’m gonna make him pay for this later," she vowed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/aa_Screen-Shot-2023-08-22-at-20235-PMjpg-JS839530757-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/aa_Screen-Shot-2023-08-22-at-20012-PMjpg-JS839530756.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/AJ_KELLY3jpg-JS814862628.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwaWyCeIWYaKOirpViuKa4y7JkppmioHqurcqeZKaZmqS%2Fbq%2FHmqWgnV2htrexjKycoKWVo8Fw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-tjay-was-shot-and-rushed-into-the-hospital-for-emergency-surgery.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Tjay Was Shot And Rushed Into The Hospital For Emergency Surgery</span></a>
