She has the entire room covered with her clothes," he wrote to Whitney and then shared a photo from inside the bedroom he shares with Jenelle in their home in North Carolina.&nbsp;</p><p>The photo shows Jenelle and David's bedroom with clothes nearly covering the entire floor as well as piled on their bed.</p><p>There is also trash littered about and debris scattered atop their dresser.&nbsp;</p><p>"Literally, this is all her s**t. Not one article of this clothing is mine but I'm a POS for cleaning.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"Sorry, I just need someone to vent to I have no friends except JD and he runs his mouth when he gets drunk. As if cleaning my own mess is worse than cheating. LMAO," David continued to rant.</p><p>Whitney then pivots the conversation back to the issue of who is going to pick up their daughter, as was his reasoning for reaching out in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking exclusively to The U.S. Sun Whitney called the exchange inappropriate, while her husband Shane Rich revealed he was sitting next to her throughout the day as the texts took place.</p><p>Whitney said: "A bedroom is a couple's private space, that's their bedroom, their intimate place- it was crazy that he would send me photos of it."</p><p>Shane said: "I was sitting right next to her. She was showing me the texts like 'Can you believe this?' and I was telling her to keep responding to see where David was going with all of this."</p><p>In other texts from that day, which were revealed earlier this week, <a href=#>David told his ex he dreams about her all the time</a>.</p><h2>'DAVID DREAMS ABOUT WHITNEY'</h2><p>In those exchanges, which took place later that evening, David said to Whitney: "You were perfect. You just deserve so much better than everything you've been through. That's why it makes me so sad. I think about it so much."</p><p>"And I dream about you all the time. I don't know how I ended up here instead of where I wanted to be. I don't know how WE ended up here instead of where I wanted US to be."</p><p>David then added: "I'm just so upset right now. And I wish I could turn back the clock."</p><p>Whitney, 35, said that outside of this exchange, she and David "had hardly communicated at all because Maryssa had a phone since she was eight years old.&nbsp;</p><p>"So all my communication was through her other than maybe a handful of times."</p><p>"It was very surprising not to mention the fact that he was married, still married. I was married, still married."</p><p>"It was inappropriate and very unexpected."</p><p>In the texts, David suggested <a href=#>he and Jenelle had been fighting</a>.</p><p>At one point, he texted Whitney: "I let you [and] Maryssa down. And I should have done more to keep you.</p><p>"Now I'm about to lose my family and my baby girl again for something I didn't even do. I don't understand why life is so cruel," he told his ex.</p><p>Whitney told The U.S. Sun: "From what I can recall from them- they were on the verge of separating. I'm not sure what it was over, but they had been fighting at the time and he made it sound like they were on the verge of splitting up.</p><p>"I know that was also around the time that she started her OnlyFans. I don't know if that had something to do with it," Whitney added of <a href=#>Jenelle's content endeavor</a>.</p><h2><strong>'I'D LEAVE HIM'</strong></h2><p>Whitney believes if she had appeared more open to David's advances, he would have tried to meet up with her.</p><p>"I'm sure he would have tried to see me, considering what he was saying."</p><p>"This would be the end of a relationship for most people," she added.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think when you are with someone and they were married to someone else or in a long-term relationship with someone else, of course, that is the last person that you want them to be contacting, especially in that manner."</p><p>"If this was my marriage, I'd be leaving him," Whitney said.</p><p>"I would get upset, it would have bothered me very much. I'd be very upset.</p><p>Maryssa's mother also made it crystal clear that her ex contacting her in this way was absolutely unwanted.</p><p>"I left him in July of 2012, so I don't want him dreaming about me."</p><p>She added that it would infuriate her if she was Jenelle, thinking about how she's sleeping next to David and knowing he was dreaming about her the whole time.&nbsp;</p><p>"When they're laying in bed together and he's dreaming about me all the time, that would hurt if I were Jenelle, I'd have to think about that too," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>After all of that, Whitney said that a few days after the text exchange, David again reached out.</p><p>"Then three days after these texts, because my birthday is always around Mother's Day, he actually messaged, 'I hope you had a Happy Mother's Day.' And I said 'I did, thank you.'</p><p>David and Whitney split in 2012 after a six-year marriage.</p><p>He moved on with Jenelle in 2015, and the couple married two years later.</p><h2><strong>TROUBLE ON 'THE LAND'</strong></h2><p>This comes as David was charged with child abuse after allegedly assaulting Jenelle's son Jace just before the teen's third runaway attempt.</p><p>According to David's criminal summons, first revealed by The U.S. Sun: "The defendant unlawfully and willingly did, being the parent of Jace V Evans, who was a child, less than 16 years of age, inflict physical injury on that child.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"The physical injury inflicted caused marks on their right arm and left and right side of the neck, and was inflicted by other than accidental means."</p><p>Additionally, in the fallout of the alleged attack, Child Protective Services took custody of Jace and he is back living with his grandmother Barbara, who raised him.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/c449f83c-1201-4076-a9f7-daebe65e1468.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/teen-mom-jenelle-evans-husband-854601596.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/teen-mom-jenelle-evans-husband-854601590.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/teen-mom-jenelle-evans-husband-854601604-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZGeCd4OSaKuenZ5iurC5jKOcp52cobJusdWapaxllJbDqrCMnpisp55is6q406GwZpqVmb%2Bwu8xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./derez-deshon-19890325-html.html><span>←</span><span>Derez De'shon (Rapper) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
