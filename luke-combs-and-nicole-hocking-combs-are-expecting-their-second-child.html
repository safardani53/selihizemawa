The pair, who already have an eight-month-old child, is set to marry in August 2020.&nbsp;The performer announced the news on Instagram with a video that included a few photos of the pair cradling their first kid, Tex Lawrence. Tex wore a romper with the words “big brother” inscribed on it. The post’s description was as follows:</p><p>“I’ve joined the 2 under 2 club!” Baby son #2 is due in September!”</p><p>Meanwhile, Take You With Me from Luke’s forthcoming record Getting Old was featured in the film. The record will be released on March 24, 2023.</p><h2>Luke Combs and Nicole Hocking Combs’ Relationship</h2><p>Luke Combs and Nicole Hocking Combs met for the first time at the 30A Songwriters Festival in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, in 2016.&nbsp;They started courting shortly after and got engaged in November 2018. Luke revealed the couple’s engagement on Instagram, where he posted a photo of Nicole sporting an engagement band while on holiday in Hawaii.</p><p>The text read:</p><p>“She said yes a while ago, but this is a far better location for photos than the kitchen.” I can’t wait to share the rest of my life with you! “I adore you!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Luke-Combs-1.jpg alt="Luke Combs" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The pair also acquired a dog together in May 2019. Luke then issued Beautiful Crazy, a song he said was influenced by Nicole. In August 2020, the couple made vows at a wedding at their home in southern Florida.&nbsp;As they shared photos from the nuptials, Luke wrote on Instagram that it was the greatest day of his life because he wedded his closest buddy. Nicole also shared her happiness on Instagram, saying she was thrilled to be sharing the remainder of her life with Luke. She went on to say that while their closest friends and family were not present for the party, the pair is looking forward to the ideal day to welcome everyone.</p><h2>In June 2022, Luke Combs and Nicole Hocking Combs have their first child.</h2><p>The pair announced that they were expecting their first child in January 2022 and shared a few photos from their pregnancy session on social media. One of them was clutching an ultrasound while Nicole held her baby’s belly. They claimed that the infant was expected in spring 2022, but no precise date was given. In June 2022, Luke Combs and Nicole Hocking Combs welcomed their first child. They announced the news on their individual social media sites, with Nicole writing:</p><p>“It’ll be difficult to top this past Father’s Day.” Tex Lawrence Combs, welcome to the universe. You are the calmest baby child, and I am honored to be your mother. “These are the times.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Luke-Combs-2.jpg alt="Luke Combs" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After their boy was born, Luke disclosed that the complete family had returned home from the hospital and that everyone was healthy and doing well. Combs earlier revealed to the Tennesseean during the CMA Fest that he expects to become a parent by parent’s Day.</p><p>While Combs was originally quiet about Nicole’s first baby, he has since spoken out about his own fatherhood experience. He stated that valuing his family is essential and that he learned a lot of new things as a result of Nicole’s baby. The pair is expecting their second child in September 2023.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijrqOVYrCwucGsZJqmlGK7qq%2FOpZxmoJ%2BYuKq6xmaaqKWSqHqivsRmnLGolZjBqrrGZquhnZmnerSxwqilnWWTnbatsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karen-danczuk-breasts-only-fans.html><span>←</span><span>Karen Danczuk is charging 152 for pic of her boobs in wet T-shirt on site used by porn stars and s</span></a>
