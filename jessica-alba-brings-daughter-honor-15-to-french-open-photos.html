My entire world was flipped right side up and I felt the deepest, most profound love.”</p><p>She added, “15 years later, I am so proud of who you have become my Honorcita, you are everything and more my baby girl 💞💫 Kind, driven, caring, intelligent, bold, silly, independent, emotional, creative, wise, rebellious… all the things.
