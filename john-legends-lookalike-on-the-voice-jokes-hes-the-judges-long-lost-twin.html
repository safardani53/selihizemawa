He described his lookalike, Talakai, as a “taller, more handsome version” of him.”</p><p>Most of the time, John gets sent pictures of people who apparently look like him, but he usually doesn’t agree. However, he even admits that Talakai “legitimately looks like him” with the same haircut.</p><p>And luckily for Talakai on The Voice, John “loves the richness and tone” of his voice. “I know for sure you have the ability to be so great on this show,” the coach told the contestant.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-doppelganger-jokes-he-s-judge-s-twin>Doppelganger jokes he’s judge’s ‘twin’</h2><p>Talakai used to sing John Legend’s Ordinary People down the hallway all the time, and often gets called the singer’s lookalike. And his Instagram bio jokes that he’s John’s “doppelganger and long-lost twin.”</p><p>Fans are convinced the two are related. When trying to choose between Reba McEntire or John as his coach, Legend shouted, “Your family.” He also added: “One of the most handsome men I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>John told the cameras: “I’ve got my twin on my side and honestly, I think we’re going to have a lot of fun together.” The undeniably similar faces even captured a selfie on the special night.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Talakai (@talakaiofficial)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-get-to-know-the-voice-s-talakai>Get to know The Voice’s Talakai</h2><p>Talakai is a contestant on The Voice season 24.
