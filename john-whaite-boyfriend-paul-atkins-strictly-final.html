This is a life where people like you have a tolerance level towards others' sexuality, as though it‚Äôs only acceptable when it‚Äôs on your terms.</p><p>"And until people like you stop asking questions like this we won‚Äôt take our eyes off the ball because we cannot. Because within recent history people were prosecuted for their sexuality. People are thrown off buildings because they love someone from the same sex.</p><p>"Enjoy the sequins that‚Äôs just artistry with artists and creativity. But here, this is life.
