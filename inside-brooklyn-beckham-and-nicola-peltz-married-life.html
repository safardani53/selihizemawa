Brooklyn shared a series of photos of himself and his then-girlfriend-now-wife Nicola posing in front of a bathroom mirror. While Nicola published an intimate mirror photo in which Beckham could be seen naked checking his phone.</p><p>Following the announcement of their relationship on Instagram, the pair was observed at various fashion events together, including Paris Fashion Week and the Saint Laurent presentation.&nbsp;Brooklyn proposed to Nicola in July 2020, after they had been dating for less than a year. Beckham recounted asking Peltz to marry him in a gazebo loaded with lights, flowers, champagne, and caviar while appearing on The Late Late Show with James Corden.</p><p>“I couldn’t open the bottle of wine, which was quite humiliating. I eventually opened it after 10 minutes, poured her a glass, and went down on my knees. She had no idea what I was up to. I began telling her how much I adore her. It was just around five minutes long. And then I reach back, grab the ring, open it, and ask, ‘Will you marry me?’ Because I want to spend the rest of my life with you. ‘You’re my best buddy,’ I say.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Brooklyn-Beckham-3.jpg alt="Brooklyn Beckham" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to claim that Peltz cried for the next five minutes as he waited for a response, which he described as “a little nerve-wracking.”&nbsp;Brooklyn and Nicola had planned to marry before 2022, however, their wedding had to be postponed owing to the COVID-19 outbreak. Beckham announced in an interview with Hello! in November 2021:</p><p>“If COVID hadn’t been a thing, we’d have loved to be married by now, and it’s been a little tough.”</p><p>Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz played a hilarious game with British Vogue before their wedding, in which the Holidate star stated that she was “terrified for the first dance,” while Beckham admitted that he’d be “more likely to weep on their wedding day.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigp6uZmbJurtGopqSkqaN6o7HCpJ%2BapV2Wu6V5zaKaqKSRYr2muNOzZKaZoqe2prCMpaCfnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aaron-carter-im-finally-ready-to-share-my-truth-about-michael-ja.html><span>←</span><span>I'm Finally Ready to Share My Truth About Michael Jackson</span></a>
