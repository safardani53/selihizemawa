That’s one way of puttin git.</p><p>She revealed: "Even though people who know who have been around for a long time like … Yolanda Hadid … went to Aaron."</p><p>"And what he does is very interesting," Kyle opined. "And what you do is really amazing,” said Kyle, 51. “Can you tell us a little about that?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/denise-richards-knows-her-ex.png><p>Aaron began very bluntly: ‘Everything you’ve been taught about how diseases process and stuff works is not true.”</p><p>He then paused, expressing: “I have to be careful."’</p><p>Denise then cautioned him: "We already have people following us, be careful."</p><p>The implication here is that "they" don’t want him spilling too many closely guarded medical secrets that would overturn the medical industry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Let me just –” Aaron started, before his wife interrupted.</p><p>“I know," she assured him, "but be careful how you say all this."</p><p>Aaron told the dinner party, in an apologetic tone: "I have to be careful."</p><p>"Say what?” Kyle then asked, inviting him to. “Explain."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Aaron began his spiel: "Age of 12 I was living next to the largest nuclear facility in North America. I watched everybody die of cancer."</p><p>"I couldn’t understand why we could split an atom with sound and cause a nuclear explosion,” he recalled.</p><p>“If you look at an atom, there’s lots of space, right?" he reasoned.</p><p>Aaron then listed subatomic particles: Electron, proton, neutron, whatever."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"There’s a lot of space, space, it’s empty space, right?" Aaron challenged.</p><p>"99.9 percent is space," he added, "but it’s oscillating at a frequency that appears to be real in our reality."</p><p>"Does that make sense?" Aaron asked.</p><p>Just as much sense as it did in Honey I Shrunk The Kids, where a similar pitch was designed to sound just real enough to explain the film’s premise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Traditional isn’t traditional,” Aaron began to lecture. “It’s allopathic. And allopathic, it means alternative medicine. Look it up."</p><p>"It’s all a measurement of the electromagnetic spectrum frequency," he continued.</p><p>"I break down stuff so you can all heal you," Aaron claimed. "I don’t heal anybody, by the way. I remove blocks, discord, information."</p><p>After this, it’s only a matter of time before he gives&nbsp;an in-depth interview with Goop, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Lisa Rinna, in a confessional, revealed that her husband “has been involved with fusion energy for 30 years."</p><p>"And I know a lot about it," she remarked. "And I am trying to wrap my brain around what Aaron is saying."</p><p>Aaron claimed: "I ruptured my Achilles tendon. I regrew it in two months no surgery. How’s that possible?"</p><p>Garcelle marveled in response: "No surgery, is that what you’re saying? Without surgery?” To that, Aaron replied: “zero."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Aaron then made an alarming claim: "There’s cancer in every one of you right now. Cancer happens all the time."</p><p>This is where Denise cautioned that some sinister power has has been having the two of them followed.</p><p>She told her dinner companions: "If we end up off of Mulholland [Drive], you know why."</p><p>You know, if someone actually wanted them dead (like a deranged ex), saying something like that is almost an invitation to throw off suspicion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At this point, it came up that "Big Pharma" or some other force might object, but Aaron countered: "I don’t even care."</p><p>"I do," Denise disagreed, reiterating: "We already have people following us." Aaron echoed the claim.</p><p>"Aaron has a job where people get tremendous results and sometimes certain organizations don’t like to see those results," Denise lamented.</p><p>Denise continued in confessional: "because they make a lot of money otherwise. And there’s times we’re followed."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Aaron then asked: "Do you want to know why cancer comes in?"</p><p>"Because it’s protecting you of an infection your immune system did not respond to and you would have died in 12 hours," he claimed.</p><p>"It’s your best friend," Aaron alleged, "that protected you from something that’s going to shoot you in the head with a bullet. That’s what cancer is."</p><p>"I’ll prove it all day long,” he added. “We can split an atom with sound, cause a nuclear explosion, kill people. You can’t figure out if it’s cancer?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Lisa Rinna then asked Aaron about the "common cold.”</p><p>Aaron got rude and dismissive for some reason, here, accusing her: “you have no idea what I really do."</p><p>Lisa hit back with "I have an idea." Aaron claimed that she couldn’t possibly, and invited her to come to his office.</p><p>This is when Denise put her foot down: "We’re not talking about this anymore. It’s for our safety. Stop."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Well that was all very interesting, even if Aaron got a little (a lot) rude with Lisa at the end.</p><p>But we’re sure that Bravo would be the first to say that airing that discussion does not constitute medical advice.</p><p>Whether you have cancer or the common cold or, say, COVID-19, going to the doctor is the go-to recommendation.</p><p>Also, we suspect that a lot of people were disturbed to hear his description of cancer, which has killed countless millions, as a "best friend."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We here at THG are not medical experts, and are also not experts in whatever Aaron does.</p><p>However, the general medical community would likely recommend a doctor’s appointment over visiting some sort of … sound wizard.</p><p>Honestly, anyone else feel sorry for Denise, here?</p><p>She really thinks that they’re being stalked because of his job. And who knows? Maybe some wacko is doing just that.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 10 Preview is Here (And It’s Bananas)!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WBcLDEp6CsnV2ntqS0wKubrGWgmryxuMRmrpqmpGK6pnnDnpidZZ%2BrsrN5zLJkoa2jl66vsNJmrqiqm2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-challenge-baby-bumps-mtv-stars-pregnancy-pics.html><span>←</span><span>The Challenge Baby Bumps: MTV Stars Pregnancy Pics</span></a>
