If you’ve played <a href=#>Pokémon GO</a>, some aspects of the monster-hunting installment will look familiar while learning the ropes for unique mechanics baked around skills and equipment upgrading.</p><p>A known “trick” among players who have enjoyed other location-based Niantic games is that you can play them without moving by using GPS programs — short for spoofing.</p><p>Usually, you’d be required to walk around your local streets or hang out in the yard to trigger events and whatnot. By spoofing, you can manipulate your location freely. If you’re curious, here’s what to know about it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Niantic</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Monster Hunter Now' Spoofing explained:</h2><p><a href=#>GPS location spoofing</a> is a method you can abuse with third-party programs to play Monster Hunter Now on your mobile device without moving. You can do this through a mobile app or by plugging in your mobile device to your PC to access a spoofing program while playing.</p><p>Some programs also have other features, like adding a joystick overlay to your screen or allowing you to use a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual joystick</a> to control your location.</p><p>Moreover, spoofing software can force your character to wander around automatically without input. Players who don’t get the chance to walk around or are chair-bound for most of the day will see use in such programs.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Android and iOS devices can use apps to spoof in ‘Monster Hunter Now.’</h2><p>Apps such as UltFone iOS, SD iSpoofer, PGsharp, Fake GPS Location, and others are reputable spoofing tools for Android and iOS devices. It goes without saying that you should aim to use legal tools instead of illegal ones that could compromise your location or information.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@monstersaka href=#>@monstersaka</a><p>Monster Hunter Now spoofing gps joystick <a title=monsterhunternow href=#>#MonsterHunterNow</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Monster Hunter Now Spoof" href=#>♬ original sound - Monster Hunter Now Spoof</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Niantic via TikTok</a></figure><p>These app tools will have subscriptions, user-friendly interfaces, and support for other AR games, but unfortunately, you can be pestered with ads while playing. Installation for the programs will be different, so it’s best to look up sources to download them safely if you choose to do so.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will I get banned for spoofing 'Monster Hunter Now'?</h2><p>On paper, spoofing is breaking the terms of service for Monster Hunter Now, so you’re likely to get banned if found out by the developers.</p><p>Niantic has a three-strike policy for cheating, hacking, and GPS spoofing. If you decide to use spoofing tools despite knowing the consequences, tread lightly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyvv9OeqWagpaPBpr6Mp6awZaOlvLCyyKee</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-sage-steele-espn-host-muslim-ban.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Sage Steele? 5 Things To Know About ESPN Host Dubbed New Stacey Dash Hollywood</span></a>
