The rocker is a symbol for the “satanic panic” that took hold of the decade after the public became obsessed with equating anything from rock music to fantasy games with the worship of the devil.</p><p>“It was really kind of an interesting time,” the <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a> alum told <a href=#>Inverse</a> magazine in May about the research he did into the period. “Heavy metal really stands in the face of rusty American values. And it’s very kind of it’s a real stark contrast. I think it must have been kind of crazy. I think it’s really explored very brilliantly in this season.”</p><p>Season 4 of the <a href=#>science fiction drama</a> picks up less than a year after season 3 ends and follows the fractured Hawkins gang as they attempt to deal with the horrors of high school. The Byers family (<a href=#><strong>Winona Ryder</strong></a>, <strong>Charlie Heaton</strong> and <strong>Noah Schnapp</strong>) and a powerless Eleven (<a href=#><strong>Millie Bobby Brown</strong></a>) remain thousands of miles away in California as those left behind — including Mike (<strong>Finn Wolfard</strong>), Lucas (<a href=#><strong>Caleb McLaughlin</strong></a>), Dustin (<strong>Gaten Matarazzo</strong>), Max (<a href=#><strong>Sadie Sink</strong></a>), Nancy (<strong>Natalia Dyer</strong>) and Steven (<strong>Joe Keery</strong>) face a new threat from the Upside Down.</p><p>The <strong>Duffer Brothers</strong>, who called season 4 of Stranger Things their “Game of Thrones season” during an interview with <a href=#>Collider </a>in April, cast Quinn after he portrayed Koner on the HBO fantasy series in 2018. The actor, who gets <a href=#>directly thrown into</a> the show’s biggest storyline, agreed with the director duo that the newest installment of the supernatural thriller matches GOT in terms of scope.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Some of the stuff that we got to do … I can’t talk about, [but] was great,” he told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> earlier this month. “There was one sequence in the woods. It was a night shoot. We got there and the whole forest was lit up. It was so thrilling. There’s some sequences in it that are just — going to be massive, I think.”</p><p>Scroll below to learn more about the newest Stranger Things actor:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BstbB5yKxko6ejmr2pedCuoKemXWp6tbTIp56sZaSkeqy6zrBkmpqfqsFuv9OrmKeflad6tbTIp56sZZGYwbC%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./milton-martinez.html><span>←</span><span>Milton Martinez</span></a>
