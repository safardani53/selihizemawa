He spent a lot of time as a child experimenting with her makeup and by junior high was wearing full makeup to school. Jeffree was close friends with tattoo artist <strong>Kat Von D</strong>, who is responsible for much of his body art. The pair had a falling out and on July 17, Kat took to&nbsp;Instagram to publicly disassociate herself from Jeffree, claiming that ,”After years of making excuses for, and rationalizing Jeffree’s inappropriate behavior (including, promoting drug use, racism, and bullying) I can no longer hold my tongue after recent events.” She also pulled a shade of lipstick named after him from her cosmetics collection. She also said she wanted to “apologize to anybody and everybody who has ever had to deal with any of his negativity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGianqSVl3yrscWfqZ6dXajBor6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-mcavoy-dating-alexandra-shipp-anne-marie-duff-divorce.html><span>←</span><span>James McAvoy Dating Alexandra Shipp?
