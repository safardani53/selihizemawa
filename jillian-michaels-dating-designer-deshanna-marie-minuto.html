"We've found we're better friends and parents living apart than staying together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The longtime couple <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>got engaged during an episode of Michaels' E! reality show</a>, Just Jillian, in 2016 after the fitness guru popped the question in a private movie theater. Michaels had already given Rhoades a ring, so she instead placed an engagement ring on her own finger during the proposal.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jillian Michaels/Intagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The couple has two children together</a> ‚Äî daughter Lukensia, 8, who was adopted from Haiti in 2012, and son Phoenix, 6, whom Rhoades gave birth to in the same month. Michaels said they'll continue to co-parent their kids.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Life and people change but our love for one another and commitment to raising our two kids as an inseparable team remains," she wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">News of her relationship with Minuto comes after it was announced on Monday that Michaels is walking 100 miles to raise "desperately needed" money for South Sudanese refugees.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2016, Michaels attended a documentary screening that changed her life. While she initially went to show support for a fitness client who had worked on the short film Refugee, she remembered feeling "shattered" once she learned <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>about the refugee crisis</a> happening across five continents.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I didn't know what to expect," Michaels told PEOPLE. "There was a woman in this documentary who was sick, and she traveled on foot to escape her country and died. Her death was totally preventable, and I was thinking that I would never have the strength to do what she did."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former Biggest Loser trainer immediately went to the <a title="(opens new window)" href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR)</a> ‚Äî the arm of the United Nations that helps refugees ‚Äî to ask what she could do.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It took several years to come up with a plan, but Michaels went on a self-funded mission trip in March to meet with South Sudanese refugees in the Congo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I spent three days and three nights in a refugee settlement there, and I got to see what they're doing on the ground and where the money is going and what the crisis is like, at least in that region, because it's a huge issue," she says. "That's where I really had the opportunity to dig in."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Michaels learned that the Congo needs $30-40 million to help <a title="(opens new window)" href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>more than 95,700 South Sudanese refugees</a> now living in the country, but so far they have just 12 percent of the money.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Jillian Michaels.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Michaels was already encouraging people to donate money on her social platforms, but she wanted to get more involved in a way that fit with her background as a trainer. So in conjunction with the UNHCR, she decided to start the Step with Jillian program. Starting on July 1, she has pledged to walk 100 miles during the month of July to raise funds specifically for the South Sudanese refugees.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">People all over the world can sign up to raise money and walk the 100 miles like Michaels, or they can walk whatever distance works for them. Ideally, Michaels hopes each person can raise at least $100, which covers the cost of three emergency rescue kits with a towel, thermal blanket, bottled water, energy bar, dry clothing and shoes. But since every little bit helps, Michaels will give <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>free access to her app</a> for the month to anyone who pledges at least $15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iarq3Ax2ihoqScnq6vecyimqGZlaHAbrDAraCnn12ZsrS1xqecq2WUmsCprc2nmGalkae2pnnMoqWurJ9k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lo-bosworth-married-dating-boyfriend.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Is Lo Bosworth Married after Split with Boyfriend Scott?</span></a>
