He started to explore his dreams after traveling to New York when he was a teen and later attending high school in San Antonio, Texas.</p><p>“Peso Pluma is really a combination of everything I like, of all the cities I’ve lived in, cultures I’ve come to know. It has all helped me,” he told Billboard in July 2023. “When I went to the United States, I was listening to <a href=#><strong>Kanye [West]</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Drake</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong> </a>— it’s actually because of their songs that I learned to speak English. I’d come home from school and study their lyrics to try to understand the references they were making.”</p><p>Scroll down for more to know about the singer following his historic VMAs debut:</p><h3>What Song Did Peso Pluma Perform at the VMAs?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Who-Is-Peso-Pluma-6.jpg><p>During his debut appearance at the 2023 MTV VMAs, Pluma sang “Lady Gaga” to the excited crowd.

Today, I see that people are proud of our movement. Back then, they’d think that Mexicans couldn’t have a No. 1 song singing corridos and that regional Mexican music was only regional, not global. Today, all those barriers have been broken.”</p><h3>Has Peso Pluma Been Involved in Any Controversies?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Who-Is-Peso-Pluma-1.jpg><p>Ahead of his MTV VMAs performance, the <a href=#>El Paso Times reported that Pluma got death threats</a> from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel in relation to his upcoming concert at Caliente Stadium in Tijuana.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The outlet noted that a banner was found on a bridge in Tijuana reading, “This goes to Peso Pluma, refrain from presenting yourself on October 14, because it will be your last show due to your disrespect and loose tongue, you show up and we are going to [break you].”</p><p>Pluma has not yet commented on the situation, but his concert is still scheduled to take place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6hp12ewG68xKymZqicqrqieZRmq6GhnpzAbsDOZqKnp6dirqfAxKtkrKGenLKzv4ymq69lpqKutHnDnpmurF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-maleni-cruz-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Maleni Cruz Dating Now</span></a>
