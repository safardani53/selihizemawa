Leading man <a href=#>Gerry Turner</a> makes connections from night one and almost every time he has to send someone home, he does so with tears in his eyes. This is a group of much older contestants than viewers are used to and they are all truly here for the right reasons.</p><p>Another way The Golden Bachelor differs from the flagship show is its much shorter episodes — at just an hour, they span half the time as The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. And the season itself is shorter than the original series too.</p><p>With that said, when is the Season 1 finale of The Golden Bachelor? Keep scrolling to find out!</p><p><strong>Plus: If you want to know who Gerry picks during the finale, stick around for Reality Steve's spoilers at the end of this post.</strong></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is 'The Golden Bachelor' finale in 2023?</h2><p>Since The Golden Bachelor is only eight episodes long, that means the finale is right around the corner — but when, exactly? Well, on Nov. 1, 2023, ABC finally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> the details regarding the rest of the season! So, mark your calendars because the two-hour finale airs on Thursday, Nov. 30, 2023.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">You can watch 'The Golden Bachelor' on Hulu too.</h2><p>If you can't get enough of Gerry and his lovely ladies on Thursday nights, you can <a href=#>re-watch The Golden Bachelor on Hulu</a> the following day. But it's no big surprise for fans since The Bachelor airs on Hulu as well each season.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And, since older seasons of The Bachelor are on Hulu, it is all but guaranteed that The Golden Bachelor will remain on Hulu long after the first season is finished. So you can always go back and see Gerry fall in love all over again. Or, you know, just skip through that and watch all of the drama between Kathy and Theresa again.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will there be a second season of 'The Golden Bachelor'?</h2><p>As of now, The Golden Bachelor hasn't been renewed for a second season. But the shorter episode length and genuine nature of the castembwrs has fans responding pretty positively to the Bachelor spinoff. So it wouldn't be surprising to get another season of a different Golden Bachelor lead ready to find love again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It also makes you wonder if there will be a Golden Bachelorette series next. We have plenty of contenders from Gerry's season who could take the reins and lead her own season of a spinoff. Like Faith, whose first impression rose from Gerry makes her look like a frontrunner right away. Or Kathy, who is seen as something of a villain at different times. For now, though, let's just focus on getting more Golden Bachelor in our lives, OK?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who does Gerry pick on 'The Golden Bachelor'?
