The other main colours are cream and neutral — it is very tastefully done.</p><p>"The ceilings are ornate and very high, although these have been dropped in the bathrooms, which are all marble. There is a very grand staircase, and chandeliers throughout.</p><p>"The stature and grandeur of the house cannot be compared to anything else on the market, where luxury properties already sell for £4,000 to £6,000 per sq ft."</p><h2>AMAZING PROPERTY PAINSTAKINGLY RESTORED</h2><p>Vanity Fair reported that Her Majesty was a visitor to the mansion a few years ago, around the time that QIPCO [Qatar Investment & Projects Development Holding Company] became the first commercial sponsor of Royal Ascot.</p><p>The Queen's love of racing is well known - she was recently <a href=#>inducted into the Hall of Fame</a>.</p><p>And it is a love she shares with Sheikh Fahad - brother of Sheikh Hamad, said to be the 'driving force' behind Dudley House, a property he 'shares' with his close family.</p><p>Recalling his brother's move into racing, Sheikh Hamad said: "One day, we were home in Qatar, and he was concentrating on the TV, which was broadcasting the race.</p><p>"He said, 'I have a runner'. I said, 'since when?' I was shocked!"</p><p>Turns out that was the start of a love affair with racing for Sheikh Fahad, a man champion jockey Oisin Murphy calls 'my boss'.</p><p>Sheikh Fahad, the son of a former prime minister of Qatar, bought his first horse when he was still at school and without his family's knowledge.</p><p>Now his meteoric rise has seen him become the face of Qatar Racing Ltd.</p><p>There have been top class winners in Britain, Ireland, France, Japan, Australia and the US.</p><h2>RACING POWERHOUSES</h2><p>They are just as much a powerhouse now, whether it be winning on the track or generously sponsoring big events, like last month's QIPCO Champions Day at Ascot.</p><p>Of course, when not at the track or at Tweenhills stud farm near Cheltenham, Sheikh Fahad and his brothers can watch the action on TV in Dudley House, where apparently everything is run 'like in Downton Abbey'.</p><p>Describing life there, Lady Elizabeth Anson, an events planner and first cousin to The Queen, told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>: "At 6pm, the staff changes into white tie and tails."</p><p>Not a million miles away from the dress code for the posh areas at Royal Ascot.</p><p>Racing is a sport for all the family and Sheikh Fahad, part of the Qatari Royal family, watches it all with wife Melissa.</p><p>Brilliant pictures on her social media page showed them celebrating when Kameko won the Guineas.</p><p>There was also the snap standing next to The Queen after Roaring Lion won the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>An amazing London property, hugely successful horses and a booming yard.</p><p>Sheikh Fahad really is onto a winner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000434144444.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5aabeef9-7f59-4a49-8213-6e2b5c25e1c2.jpg><h4>FREE BETS <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><p>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
