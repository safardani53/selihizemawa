The Horse & Barge pub, in the Dalmuir area of Clydebank, has been embroiled in a sex scandal this week after the X-rated snaps emerged on social media.
Scott Mackie, who is the licensee and runs the boozer, has since closed the bar but claims that it is not related to the images being shared online."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Scott f*** all to do with you c***s."</p><p>The pub boss has now claimed that the closure of the bar is not linked to the pictures being leaked, and instead said it was because the business was "not being profitable".</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>But this claim has been disputed by the operator Star Bars and Pubs, a Heineken business which owns the pub. The firm is now investigating the incident.</p><p>Speaking to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clydebank Post</a>, Mackie said: "Both things are totally unrelated, my issue is probably the absolutely mortifying images of me, which I admit was a stupid mistake on my part on a very drunken night where pictures of me were taken without my knowledge or consent.</p><p>"And by coincidence they happened to appear on every social media platform the day I decided to close the pub.</p><p>"The actual closure of the pub was my own personal decision that I had been considering for a few weeks."</p><p>He added that it "broke his heart" to shut the pub after he ran it himself since he was 25-years-old.</p><p>Angry locals have hit out at the pub sex scandal and claim staff members have been left without jobs after it was shut down.</p><p>Reacting to the scandal, one said: “This has everything to do with him shutting them doors he knew he would get tossed out when them pictures were leaked.</p><p>“The staff are now forced out their jobs with no warning so makes you think what kind of a boss he was to start with, not to mention putting himself and the others that are in them pictures in that position doing what he was doing on the pool table.</p><p>“It certainly wouldn't be me playing pool anywhere near that table in the future.”</p><p>They added: “(It’s) nowt to do with it not being a viable business cause that pub was busy every night.”</p><p>A spokesperson for Star Pubs & Bars told the Scottish Sun that Mackie shut the pub "without warning", adding that they "would not condone activity of this kind".</p><p>They said: "The operator of The Horse & Barge is self-employed and is responsible for the day-to-day management of the pub, including its staff and activities.</p><p>"They have closed the pub without notice and we are working to get it reopened as quickly as possible.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“We would not condone any activity of this kind and take these kinds of allegations extremely seriously.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/2022-horse-barge-pub-dumbarton-765867187.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/2022-horse-barge-pub-dumbarton-765867181.jpg><p><strong>We pay for your stories and videos!
