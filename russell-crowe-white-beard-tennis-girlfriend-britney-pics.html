The iconic actor was joined by his girlfriend <strong>Britney Theriot</strong>, 30, for the Sydney outing and was photographed while walking and while playing against friends.

Britney also chose to wear comfortable clothing that included a light grey tank top, dark teal skirt and white sneakers. She topped it off with her own white and black baseball cap and had her long blonde locks into a low ponytail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/russell-crowe-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>As Russell and his friends were heavy into the game, celebs were spotted sitting in the stands and watching. Some of the A-listers included&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chris Hemsworth</strong></a> and <strong>Elsa Pataky</strong>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Natalie Portman</strong></a>, <strong>Jeff Goldblum</strong>, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Isla Fisher</strong></a>, according to the Daily Mail.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Although Russell and Britney have sparked romance rumors since they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted kissing</a> at a Sydney tennis court in Nov., they have yet to confirm their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romance</a>. The Gladiator star is believed to have met the stunning beauty, who is an actress-turned-real estate agent, on the set of his movie Broken City way back in 2013. Once she was in the public eye with Russell, she also made headlines for looking a lot like his ex-wife <strong>Danielle Spencer</strong>, whom he divorced in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/russell-crowe-shutterstock-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Although they have been separated since 2012, Russell and Danielle, who share sons <strong>Charles</strong> 17, and <strong>Tennyson</strong>, 14, have remained cordial and often speak highly of each other in interviews. “The marriage ended, but that didn’t mean our friendship ended. We’ve had holidays together in the past and we can happily sit down and chat,” Danielle told the Daily Telegraph last year. “We have a lot of respect for each other and I consider him to be a member of my family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5FwZquto6iyrbiMnKmor5VixKm1055km52Rp7FuwMSnpaKrXZy2s7jFq6CeppRir7O106ecsmWgnrC0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho.html><span>←</span><span>Rumer Willis at Vanity Fair, L'Oreal Paris, &amp;amp; Hailee Steinfeld host DJ Night</span></a>
