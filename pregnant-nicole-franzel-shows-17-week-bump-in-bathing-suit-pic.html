A lot of people don’t know her beyond Big Brother, but … I love her to death.”</p><p>Fellow competitor <strong>Natalie Negrotti</strong> exclusively told Us Weekly four months later that she “could tell in the Big Brother house that Victor had a huge crush on Nicole.” The Venezuela native, 30, explained, “Just the way he would look at her — and he was always looking for her — you could definitely tell he had a huge crush on her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>Amazing Race </a>alums <a href=#>got engaged</a> in September 2018 during a visit to the Big Brother house with fellow alums <strong>Paul Abrahamian</strong>, <strong>Josh Martinez</strong> and <strong>Derrick Levasseur</strong>.</p><p>While the couple have <a href=#>postponed their nuptials amid the coronavirus pandemic</a>, they exclusively<a href=#> shared their new wedding date</a> with Us in January.
