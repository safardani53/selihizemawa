'Spades is a death pack ugh ugh ugh'</p><p>"There's just no helping some people."</p><p>Another tweeted: "I think the wall art they’ve created looks fantastic! My god that Chris is a misery isn’t he?! Your hotel is called Pack of Cards, you’re going to have to embrace the theme ffs."</p><p>A third savagely added: "No wonder the locals don’t go to Pack O’ Cards in Coombs Martin. The male owner is arrogant, know-it-all but know-nothing really and deeply offensive.</p><p>"Why call for help and then disregard the advice!"</p><p>Meanwhile a fourth wrote: "The man is a right miserable old s**. He’s just not remotely suited to being a hotelier. He’s also very patronising towards Alex.</p><p>"Why do these people who are struggling not take advice from an expert."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hotel4.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hotel2-1.png><p><strong>The Hotel Inspector airs Thursdays at 9pm on Channel 5.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlpZoBzgZJqZq2glWK1sMDEpWSipqOlsqTAzqtkr6GVrLKzv4yap6mZnKGypXnOn52epqOew6Z5zrClnqpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-york-fashion-week-2023-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Photos From New York Fashion Week Hollywood Life</span></a>
