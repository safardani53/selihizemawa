From cursing at police to flag-burning, Jason lists the offenses that apparently should warrant violence (or worse) in rural areas.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did CMT cancel Jason Aldean’s “Try That in a Small Town” music video?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@Jason_Aldean</a> - who was on-stage during the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert in 2017 that killed 60 people and wounded over 400 more - has recorded a song called “Try That In A Small Town” about how he and his friends will shoot you if you try to take their guns. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hWGdEgS33v</a></p>— Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) <a href=#>July 17, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On Tuesday, July 18, 2023, Country Music Television suddenly pulled the video from its rotation. However, they gave no insight as to why. We can only assume that it has something to do with the increasing backlash the musician is facing for the song and its unsettling messaging.</p><p>Other renowned country music artists have noted that they do not support the lyrics behind “Try That in a Small Town” by any means. On Twitter, singer Sheryl Crow blasted Jason for promoting gun violence as a mass-shooting survivor.</p><p>“I’m from a small town. Even people in small towns are sick of violence,” the “Soak Up the Sun” songwriter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>.</p><p>“There’s nothing small-town or American about promoting violence.
