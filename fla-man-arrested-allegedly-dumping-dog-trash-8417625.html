He’s then seen removing a bundled up trash bag from his trunk and then tossing it into the dumpster several feet away, according to the sheriff’s office.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the investigation continued, detectives learned the dog was microchipped and that its original owners had died. Investigators were then led to a nearby home, where they found a vehicle matching the description of the one driven by the suspect in the surveillance footage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Detectives made contact with the homeowner, identified as Anthony Bellman, who they claim was wearing the same clothing as the suspect in the footage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Authorities said Bellman had allegedly told his family he was going to take the dog to be euthanized, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>WBBH-TV</a> and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Fort Myers News-Press</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

It’s unclear if he has entered a plea or retained an attorney to speak on his behalf.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the statement, Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno called Bellman “a selfish and cruel individual, who clearly has no regard for animals.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We are one team that comes together to be a voice for the innocent, such as Xyla,” the sheriff said. “We will never stop holding individuals accountable for these heinous actions here in this county.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, the dog is recovering at Lee County Domestic Animal Services, where it will remain until it is adopted.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5ahrm65wKdkmqqimsC1scNmmKWklZyypbjYZpuupaCeu6h5w6ieZqyilsCpeZdtaHBuYmo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-bieber-using-church-dates-to-convince-hailey-baldwin-to-s.html><span>←</span><span>Using Church Dates to Seduce Hailey Baldwin Again?</span></a>
