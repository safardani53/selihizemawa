The actor, who originally left in 2015, died off screen. Luke’s recent bride, Tracy Quartermaine (<strong>Jane Elliot</strong>) revealed to his soul mate on the show, Laura (<strong>Gene Francis</strong>), that the character died in a cable car accident in Austria. Toward the end of the show, it was implied the character was maybe killed off by Victor Cassadine (<strong>Charles Shaughnessy</strong>).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Anthony-Geary-General-hospital-luke-dead-ss-post1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>When the actor announced his retirement in May 2015, he said, “I’m just weary of the grind and have been for 20 years. I really don’t want to die, collapsing in a heap, on that GH set one day. That wouldn’t be too poetic.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Months later, however, after he won his eighth Emmy for the ABC soap, he backtracked on the discussion, telling&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly,&nbsp;“If the story is interesting to me and it works out, I may come back to the show for six weeks or so. I really don’t think we have exhausted what [Luke] can do. It depends on the writers and how far they want to look.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>General Hospital&nbsp;has been in the news lately, with another actor <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>parting ways</a> with the long-running institution.&nbsp;<strong>Steve Burton</strong>, who played Jason Morgan on the show, revealed in a Nov. 23 Instagram that he was “let go” from the daytime series after not complying with the show’s vaccine mandate.&nbsp;“I wanted you to hear it from me personally,” he said. “Unfortunately,&nbsp;General Hospital&nbsp;has let me go because of the vaccine mandate. I did apply for my medical and religious exemptions, and both of those were denied. Which, you know, hurts. But this is also about personal freedom to me. I don’t think anybody should lose their livelihood over this.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>He went on, “But with that being said, I’ll always be grateful for my time at General Hospital. I love it there. I grew up there. I grew up with some of you, so I’ll always be grateful. And I believe that when one door closes, multiple doors open,” he stated. “That’s always been my perspective. So I am excited to see what the future brings, and maybe one day if these mandates are lifted, I can return and finish my career as Jason Morgan. That would be an honor. And if not, I’m going to take this amazing experience, move forward, and be forever grateful.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>General Hospital’s vaccine mandate took effect on Nov. 1, according to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. All cast and crew in Zone A were required to be vaccinated at the start of the month.</p><figure id=attachment_4588029 class="wp-caption alignnone" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4588029></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye49tZqCdnpq%2ForiMoaasqJmprq15y66inmWUnrK0ecCnq6Gnnq56qLHAq7Bmo5mhuaawjKidn2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kat-stickler-new-boyfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Kat Stickler Gives Ex-Boyfriend Cam a Shoutout in New TikTok</span></a>
