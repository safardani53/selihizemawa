The preacher was 88 years old when he died, according to reports. According to his family, Jack Hayford died quietly and ate supper with his wife, Valarie, on the night of his death, as well as talking to his grandchildren.</p><p>Jack Hayford, popularly known as Pastor Jack, founded The Church On The Way in Van Nuys, California, and served as its founding pastor for more than 30 years. His work as a best-selling novelist was also recognized, as he wrote and co-wrote more than 50 novels. Aside from that, the pastor wrote 500 hymns and choruses. Majesty was one of the pastor’s most well-known praise anthems.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jack-Hayford-1.jpg alt="Jack Hayford" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>In 1997, Pastor Jack also established King’s University in Southlake, Texas. He was the university’s chancellor until handing up the office to Pastor Robert Morris. King University announced the death of its founder, Jack Hayford, in a public statement, saying:</p><p>“Pastor Jack Hayford, founder and emeritus chancellor of The King’s University and Seminary (TKU), died on Sunday, January 8, at his residence in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, California.”</p><h2>“Besides my father, no one influenced me more for the kingdom than Pastor Jack Hayford”: Netizens lament the late pastor’s passing.</h2><p>As a pastor, Jack touched many people’s lives, and immediately after his passing, social media was swamped with tributes as people shared their memories and sentiments about him. A guy, who happens to be the previous president of Foursquare Church, came to Twitter to discuss how his life was influenced by no one other than his father and the pastor. He stated:</p><p>“Aside from my father, no one influenced me more for the kingdom than Pastor Jack Hayford. Valarie, his wife, called me early this morning to tell me that he had quietly gone over into his heavenly reward. No one I know has had a greater influence on the Body of Christ than him.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Early this morning, my dear friend Pastor Jack Hayford went home to be with Jesus. He was 88 years old and was a pastor, teacher, servant, and man of God. For me personally, he was my mentor and spiritual father, and I am so grateful for his influence in my life. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aFK88kZhBv</a></p><p>— Robert Morris (@PsRobertMorris) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">January 8, 2023</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I will miss Pastor Jack Hayford. He stood beside me on my darkest day at New Life. He served as an Overseer for the past 15 years. He passed into glory today at 88 years old. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/K4zsNzlEEK</a></p><p>— Brady Boyd (@pastorbrady) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">January 9, 2023</a></p><h2>Pastor Jack, former president of Foursquare Gospel, is remembered.</h2><p>Jack was a well-known Christian leader who was admired by the general public for his teachings and wisdom. In addition to his other roles, he was the President of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel (ICFG) from 2004 to 2009. As the pastor died, the Foursquare Church paid tribute to the former president with a series of tweets.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jack-Hayford-2.jpg alt="Jack Hayford" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Randy Remington, the church’s current president, also issued a statement, saying:</p><p>“Pastor Jack was a Kingdom ambassador whose impact cut beyond denominations, generations, and continents. Jack’s personal life was modeled by his zeal for Spirit-filled worship, ardent intercessory prayer, and biblical teaching that exposed Jesus. He actually lived the life he wanted others to join.”</p><p>His four daughters, 11 grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and his second wife, Valarie, survive him. Hayford’s first wife, Anna Smith, died in 2017, following which the pastor remarried and married Valarie.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihmpubYrWixcWoqZ1loJbAtLHDZpiwmalirrV506GcZpmXmnqwsoxxb2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yolett-mcphee-mccuin.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Yolett McPhee-McCuin net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
