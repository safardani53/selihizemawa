Both men have upwards of 70 tattoos in their collections.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>In fact, Barker added another design to his massive collection earlier this week — and at the dentist no less. The Blink 182 drummer decided to get a barbed wire design on his left kneecap at the same time he was getting his teeth cleaned.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Why did he decide to do this, you ask? Apparently, it was in an effort to manage his time.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Kelly, for his part, hasn’t show off a new design since on Instagram since debuting his Born With Horns ink in August 2021. That said, he did reveal in an interview with GQ British Style in October of last year that he let fiancée <a href=#><strong>Megan Fox</strong> </a>give him a new tattoo that reads “the darkest fairytale.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The ink “alludes back to one of the first text messages we ever sent each other.” And even though Fox didn’t have much experience tattooing, Kelly explained that the design is the “f—king best tattoo I’ve ever seen in my life.” He added: “It looks like a fairy ghost did it, right? It’s all haunted.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6KupLTIp5xmn6Wjeqyxy6WwZpuYlruosdJmmKWapaJ6r63MnmSanqSav26zxK2roqaXYsGiwNOopmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./connecticut-woman-opens-fire-in-police-department-lobby-8348890.html><span>←</span><span>Connecticut Woman Opens Fire in Police Department Lobby, Police Say</span></a>
