Grey Sloan’s doors are staying open. Grey’s Anatomy will return for season 20. As writers and actors fought for fair deals and went on strike, shows like Grey’s Anatomy were put on hold for months. Now that the strikes are over and everyone is back at work, ABC has released new details about season 20.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Grey’s Anatomy premiered on ABC in 2005 and became a pop culture phenomenon. Fans have followed Dr. Meredith Grey and the journeys of other Grey Sloan doctors over the course of nearly two decades. So, what do we know about Grey’s Anatomy season 20?<strong> Hollywood Life</strong> is breaking down all the latest news.</p><h2>Is ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Coming Back For Season 20?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Grey’s Anatomy was renewed for season 20, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>&nbsp;reported in March 2023. The renewal was revealed as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season 19</a> was still airing.<strong> Meg Marinis</strong> will be serving as the showrunner of Grey’s Anatomy for season 20. She’ll be taking over for <strong>Krista Vernoff</strong>, who is leaving her post as showrunner of Grey’s Anatomy and sister series Station 19 at the end of their current seasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Greys-Anatomy-season-20-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>For months, Grey’s Anatomy fans have wondered if the long-running medical drama would return for season 20 at all after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ellen Pompeo</strong></a> announced that she would no longer be a series regular in season 19. The show continues to be a hit for ABC, so the stories at Grey Sloan will continue to unfold. ABC has not announced if season 20 could be the final season of the show. Grey’s Anatomy remains the longest-running primetime medical drama.</p><h2>‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Season 20 Premiere Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Grey’s Anatomy season 20 will premiere March 14, 2024, at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.&nbsp;Usually, Grey’s Anatomy is part of ABC’s fall lineup.

After complaining of a toothache all day, Teddy collapsed in the operating room just as she was about to perform emergency surgery on Sam Sutton. In the last moments of the finale, Teddy still didn’t have a pulse and Owen was desperately trying to save her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Meredith appeared in the season 19 finale as Nick, Amelia, Winston, Richard, Bailey, and Catherine traveled to Boston for the Catherine Fox Award ceremony. Meredith revealed she was completely changing course on her Alzheimer’s research, and they’d been wrong about everything this whole time.
