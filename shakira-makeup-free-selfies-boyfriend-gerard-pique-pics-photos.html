She also shared an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>adorable video</a> of Gerard and their kids playing with crabs on a sandy beach on Aug. 28. “<span title=Edited>It seems to me that my family hasn’t seen many crabs in their lives… I’ve got to take them to the beach more often…,” she wrote in the caption.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shakira-no-makeup-boyfriend-gerard-pique-mega-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Before her latest posts, Shakira and Gerard made waves after she performed alongside <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Super Bowl halftime show</a> earlier this year.

The Colombian artist’s talent has been an inspiration to many people throughout her successful career and her strong bond with Gerard is also proving to be an inspiration! Whether she’s on stage or hanging out in her private life, she always knows how to wow her fans and we’re loving it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH15e5JpZqygkaC2s62MppiknaWleqe%2BxJ5krJ2cm7amv4ybprKeop6yr7CMoJyrmaKZerG10K6cZqiZmMBuvMeoq6irXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maggie-nichols-photos-gymnast-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Photos Of The Gymnast Hollywood Life</span></a>
