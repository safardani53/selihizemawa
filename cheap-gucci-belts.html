Currently, the cheapest Gucci belt for women&nbsp;with the GG buckle starts at £249, as seen on our list, and the most expensive is £1060.</p><p>The cheapest Gucci belt for men is priced at around £250, and the most expensive is £1070.</p><p>And finally, the cheapest belt for kids is £100, and the priciest is £160.</p><h2>How can you tell if a Gucci belt is fake?</h2><p>The best way to avoid accidentally purchasing a fake Gucci belt is to purchase directly from the brand or a trusted retailer, such as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Selfridges</a>.</p><p>To check if your Gucci belt is real, have a look at the serial number. It should be 21 digits long, and start with the numbers "114" or "223".</p><p>If your Gucci belt is missing a serial number or has one which starts with "1212", then we're afraid it's almost certainly fake.</p><p>Another way to tell is to inspect the quality. If the material is fraying, the stitching isn't straight or it's missing the Gucci stamp, then these are all tell-tell signs that your belt isn't authentic.</p><h2>Where can I get a Gucci belt?</h2><p>As you can see from our shopping guide, you don't have to head straight to Gucci to shop for the best, cheapest Gucci belts.</p><p>Although of course, you can visit one of Gucci's physical stores, or head to their website too.</p><p>Luxury retailers that stock them include Selfridges, Farfetch, Flannels, MyTheresa, Liberty, Net-a-Porter and MatchesFashion – we're sure there are luxury outlets around the U.K. where you'll find them too.</p><h2>How should a Gucci belt fit?</h2><p>You don't need us to tell you that your belt should not be way too big, or way too small. If it's too big, you run the risk of having to pierce another hole to get it to fit – always get it done professionally.</p><p>You should always get a belt that comes up slightly bigger than your waist size so that the buckle pin fits through one of the middle holes, if it goes through the first or last, it's usually a bit off for size.</p><p>Of course, it also depends on where you're going to be wearing it on your body, as wearing it around your waist will require a smaller belt than if you're wearing it around your hips. So, keep that in mind too!</p><h2>How to shorten a Gucci belt</h2><p>Just like any belt, Gucci belts can be made shorter if you fasten the clasp on a tighter hole.</p><p>If there isn't a hole tight enough for you and you've bought the smallest size, official Gucci stores actually offer a service to add them for free, or you can get your local shoe-mending shop to sort it out for you.</p><p>Shoe repair shops usually also offer the service of physically shortening belts, if the size is way too big.</p><h2>Does a Gucci Belt come with a box?</h2><p>In the majority of retailers, Gucci belts come in a dust bag to keep them in tip-top condition, and they're packaged in a branded Gucci box made of cardboard.</p><p>Generally, though, the appearance of your beloved Gucci delivery depends on where you're shopping as every retailer has a different way of packaging their goods.</p><h2>How to clean a Gucci belt</h2><p>If your Gucci belt sports metal hardware then you're going to want to find a polish that can make it shiny again. We recommend using Autosol metal polish in cream form and a cloth to make it look good as new.</p><p>For the actual belt, we recommend buying leather cleaner and cleaning it by hand.</p><h2>Will a children's Gucci belt fit me?</h2><p>Everyone comes in different shapes and sizes so obviously, not everyone can fit a children's Gucci belt.</p><p>Your best bet as an adult would be the large which is made for ages six to eight. It'll fit you if you have a 25.59 waist or smaller.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZnFrZGyCcoGOnJ%2BemaBitLavwqJkm52cqcBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-caitlin-v-good-sex.html><span>←</span><span>Caitlin V Was Helping Couples Long Before 'Good Sex' on Discovery Plus</span></a>
