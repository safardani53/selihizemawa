When it comes to her go-to healthy meal right now, she admitted she’s been obsessing over homemade bowls that are easy to make and protein-packed. “It’s something you can just throw together and it tastes so amazing!” she gushed. Sami revealed she’s been making a taco bowl recently, adding greens, chickpeas and really “any vegetables.” “Stick it in the oven for about 20 minutes and it’s so good and super easy!” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Sami added that she tosses some Siete Queso — a vegan, dairy free brand — on top of the bowl as a finishing touch. When it comes to toppers, like dressings or salsas, Sami reminded readers to stay cautious about what’s put in them. “There are so many hidden calories and ingredients in dressings,” she warned. As an alternative, she shared her faves which include Bitchin’ Sauce, Primal Kitchen, or just simply making your own so you know exactly what is in it!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Sami shares more of her favorite recipes and some intense, booty burning at-home workouts on her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>YouTube channel</a>!&nbsp;She also offers a program on the app Fit Plans, which you can find&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>via her Instagram</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH14e49vZqGdkaHBqcWMrKympZWneqW1xK1kraGgqHq0rcyiZJykkae4pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fred-whitfield-rodeo.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Fred Whitfield (rodeo) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
