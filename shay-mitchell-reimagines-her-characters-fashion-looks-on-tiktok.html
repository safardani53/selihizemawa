To reimagine the queen bee, the mom of one wore a New York-chic ensemble, comprising a silk cheetah print top paired with sunglasses, gold <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> and a Chanel <a href=# data-link=1>handbag</a>.</p><p>Next, the actress dressed up as Emily Fields from Freeform’s Pretty Little Liars.

She wore a tie-dye crop top underneath a fur coat with statement earrings and cat-eye sunglasses.</p><p>The video has since amassed close to 1 million “likes” on the social media platform. Mitchell encouraged her 3.5 million followers to share their thoughts about the looks in the comments. She captioned the video, “Who’s your fave!?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shay-Mitchell-Dresses-Up-As-Characters-In-TikTok-Slide-1.jpg><p>Fans went particularly crazy over her<strong> Pretty Little Liars</strong> character. “Emily oh my god I miss you playing her she was my favorite character,” one TikTok user wrote. Another wrote, “Coming to the comments already knowing Emily won.”</p><p>Others preferred the You character’s style. “Emily is my fave character, BUT the outfit from Peach hits different,” a fan wrote.</p><p>Mitchell’s Stella character didn’t get as much love as the other two, but there were a handful of dutiful Dollface fans who praised the look. “WHY IS NO ONE VOTING FOR STELLA?!?!” a passionate follower commented. “YOU WERE MY FAV IN DOLLFACE I LOVE YOU.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6i1osWMpqCtm5iaua150Z6gppmXnrumv4yhnKtlk52us63CrZyrq12brrS0yKilZqSfpLi0ec6nZK2hm6m8rHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ross-macdonald-19890606-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ross MacDonald (Bassist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
