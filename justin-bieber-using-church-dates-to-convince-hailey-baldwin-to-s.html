Because of course they do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>This is actually part of a pattern with the Biebs.</p><p>Remember, before he and Selena were officially dating again, they were doing three things:</p><p>One, they were talking, after Justin begged her mother to put him in touch with her.</p><p>Two, they were riding bikes together. We don’t know at which exact point that transitioned into riding each other again.</p><p>Three, Justin and Selena were attending Hillsong Church services together.</p><p>That third one, many believe, added a religious element to their relationship that may have encouraged that they get back together.</p><p>Religious pressures may have even encouraged them to keep trying to make it work longer than they otherwise would have.</p><p>After all, Bieber believes that God wanted him to be with Selena.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So … is Justin Bieber just trying this same tactic, but with a different ex?</p><p>Maybe … or maybe not. Not everything has to be viewed through a cynical lens.</p><p>Hailey Baldwin is a very devout Christian. Her dad is Stephen Baldwin — no offense to Hailey, who is great, but Stephen is the diehard right-wing Baldwin.</p><p>So attending church together might not be the Biebs’ version of makeout point.</p><p>Their deep and sincere faith might just be something that the two of them have in common with each other.</p><p>We’ll see how long this reunion of exes lasts.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Justin Bieber: A Chronological List of 31 Women Who Slept With Him For Some Reason</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WDcLbUrKuipl2XtqauxKtkrquZo7Rur8euqZygXZmutbHSZquoZZOku7e1zZycZqCRnrmmxYybmKWcp567bsDOZqpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./man-utd-mccann-rangers-transfer.html><span>←</span><span>Man Utd academy prospect Charlie McCann joins Rangers B on permanent transfer after being scouted by</span></a>
