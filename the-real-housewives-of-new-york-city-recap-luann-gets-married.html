Ramona thought Bethenny was not there for her when she needed her the most and wants everyone her to cut the crap and apologize.&nbsp;</p><p>Bethenny decided the best course of action was to list all of the crappy things Ramona did to her over the years. Things took a desperate turn when they bickered over who was the most successful. Yes, that is not a word of a lie.&nbsp;</p><p>Ramona then claimed&nbsp;Bethenny was "an opportunist" who "uses people" and told her she was screwed up. "I feel sorry for you," Ramona said. "You are a bitch. You’re Bethenny, the Bitchy Witch. That’s who are you. Good luck to you."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/bethenny-frankel-dazzles-at-gala.jpg><p>Yes, Ramona was very drunk during the exchange, but at least she knows how to cause some drama for the cameras. Bethenny grew tired of being put on the spot so went to tell Carole she was leaving and they both left.&nbsp;</p><p>Ramona then rehashed her version of the argument to LuAnn&nbsp;and Sonja, and both women could only look on in shock at what they were hearing.&nbsp;</p><p>"I feel bad that every time she comes to my house, it’s a nightmare for her," Dorinda Medley said to the camera. "To be honest, I wish Ramona were leaving.</p><p>Ramona then focused her attention on Carole, claiming that Bethenny was just using her as a friend for a short while. This did not go down with Bethenny, who said: "</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/ramona-singer-in-black.jpg><p>You and I will never speak again. "You and I will never be on the same sidewalk ever again," Bethenny screeched at her former friend. It looks like they are not friends anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>The next morning, Tinsley&nbsp;and Sonja packed up to leave for New York, and could not stay civil to each other. Sonja wanted Tinsley to know that she was not to use her "house guy" as her own personal slave.&nbsp;</p><p>After some back and forth, the ladies made nice with each other, but that did not stop Tinsley from looking at apartments to get away from Sonja.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/jill-zarin-attends-a-benefit.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Jill Zarin made her triumphant return to the series, with her husband in tow. Dorinda, however, could not shut up about Bethenny being targeted by Ramona.&nbsp;</p><p>Tom then revealed that Ramona had been calling his friends to try and get the gossip on his past.&nbsp;</p><p>"Her life is in such a mess that she wants everyone to be a mess. Misery loves company," Jill said.</p><p>The episode concluded with LuAnn and Tom heading out for their wedding, but did it go without a hitch?</p><p>Tune in next week to find out!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Real Housewives All Stars: Who Should Be Cast?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WDcMDHnmSrnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBuu8VmpZ6vXa68s7eMnKCtsV2nsqStz2ajrpmeo3qosdOsZKaZoqe2prCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christian-bale-sports-fuller-figure-to-play-dick-cheney-in-film-w501364.html><span>←</span><span>Christian Bale Sports Fuller Figure to Play Dick Cheney in Film</span></a>
