Their awkward encounter saw Raymond give a tour of his humble home, which included a padlocked fridge filled with $200 worth of meat, and discuss roadkill.</p><p>That is seemingly the first and last time she met her father. In a November 2018 tweet, she confirmed Thanksgiving week 2009 was their final meeting, calling it “an important time in my life.”</p><p>The Lowrys were involved in online beef in October 2020 after Raymond criticized <a href=#>MTV</a> for portraying him negatively.</p><p>In screenshots <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">obtained </a>by The Sun, he commented: “I was on the show too and they made me look bad. I personally don’t think that show is good for young girls to watch. I think it gives them the wrong idea about being a parent so young, among other things.”</p><p>“Sorry for your bad experience on the show,” he continued in response to Kail’s sister, Mikaila. “Been there. Love ya.”</p><p>Kailyn, 31, slammed his absence in response. “No, that’s a f****** joke. Don’t even start this s***. You haven’t been around or tried with either of us nor paid child support so get the f*** outta here.”</p><p>According to his Facebook page, he still resides in Waco and maintains a relationship with Mikaila. He donated to her 2021 birthday fundraiser for St Jude Children’s Research Hospital.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Isaac Rivera (@isaacelliottr)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kailyn-oddly-misses-her-estranged-mom>Kailyn ‘oddly’ misses her estranged mom</h2><p>Irwin has been absent from Kailyn’s life since the birth of Lincoln in 2013, meaning she hasn’t met her two youngest grandsons, Lux and Creed.</p><p>“I just found that I had to cut my mom off completely,” Kailyn told her podcast listeners. “Now, I’m not as angry but now I’m starting to like, I don’t know, like my third son just turned one, and I don’t even know if my mom knows I had a third son.”</p><p>In an August 2022 Q&A, the <a href=#>Teen Mom</a> alum admitted to missing Suzi despite her never being a parent figure.</p><p>“This is such a complex question,” Lowry answered a fan. “So she was never a mom to me but oddly, yes, I miss her. And I say oddly because I’ve always said you can’t miss what you never had.”</p><p>“But I want a mom,” she added. “I wish had a mom – not even for me.
