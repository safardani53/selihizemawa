Billie Eilish should be proud!"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The people whose votes counted most - the judges - unanimously agreed, giving four enthusiastic "Yes" nods to send the band to the next round.</p><p>"I I love them," <a href=#>Howie Mandel</a> told his colleagues before turning his attention to the act onstage. "Your voice is amazing and distinctive. Great musicianship, great voice, great presentation. I want to buy tickets and come see you."</p><h2>HEAVEN SENT</h2><p>The competition show has seen some jaw-dropping performances over the years, including another singer that episode that <a href=#>brought fans to tears</a> when she took the stage with a heartfelt story.</p><p>Louisiana native Kylie Frey performed an original song called Horses in Heaven which was dedicated to her grandfather who encouraged her to follow her dreams.</p><p>The 28-year-old grew up in a big rodeo family and even reached the status of Rodeo Queen before trying her luck on <a href=#>AGT</a>.</p><p>Kylie grew up inspired by the legendary <a href=#>Reba McIntire</a> and followed in her footsteps by launching a career singing the national anthem at various rodeos across the country.</p><p>Before her performance, the vocalist spoke about her beloved late grandfather, saying: "So I wrote this song for my grandpa, he always told me that if I always sing the national anthem for every rodeo that I showed up to, that one day someone would ask me to sing the national anthem at the NFR which is the SuperBowl of rodeo.</p><p>"And that's how I was going to get my start. Because that's how Reba did and I was going to do it too," she explained.</p><p>Kylie then sang her own lyrics, telling the story of how her grandfather "taught her how to ride" and how he must be "riding horses in heaven."</p><p>The audience was left speechless and many in tears over the ballad written for her late grandparent.</p><h2>U CAN'T</h2><p>However, not every crooner is a hit.</p><p>On Tuesday's episode, the panel watched&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ukulele savant Sunny Chatum take the stage</a>&nbsp;to perform his act.</p><p>But when he began to stall,&nbsp;<a href=#>Heidi Klum</a>, 50, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Sofia Vergara</a>, 51, pressured him to sing by <a href=#>threatening to push the red button</a>.</p><p>The performer pulled several toys out of his pocket, pleading with the panel to let him show them "one more thing."</p><p>But the frustration was clear, as&nbsp;<a href=#>Simon Cowell</a>, 63, replied: "No, I'm really begging you now."</p><p>Heidi then chimed in, with a terse tone to say: "Sunny do you see this hand? It's getting real close to the red buzzer if you don't start singing right now!"</p><p>Sunny was visibly distraught as he pleaded: "No please don't! I brought you egg shakers! Please!"</p><p>But Heidi was not having it, as she shouted: "Start singing!" with her hand hovering over <a href=#>the buzzer</a>.</p><p>"Please stop!" Sunny begged as the crowd and all the cast urged him to "start singing."</p><h2>QUICK EXIT</h2><p>Finally, the contestant relented, as he promised: "OK, I'll sing. OK, I'll sing. I'm gonna sing."</p><p>Simon replied: "OK, put the things down and sing please."</p><p>Sunny said: "OK, I'm sorry," as he hid his toy shakers in his pockets.</p><p>"Hand is traveling, it's getting closer Sunny," Heidi threatened again, moving her arm just inches above the buzzer.</p><p>"Sunny! Tick tock tick tock."</p><p>Sunny answered: "OK! I'm gonna sing," as he picked up his ukulele and looked at the strings.</p><p>"Good, thank god," Simon replied.</p><p>The performer strung one chord, and then looked down at his pockets once more, saying: "I'm sorry, I just gotta tune up real quick."</p><p>But the pause was <a href=#>enough to push Heidi over the edge</a> as she slammed her hand down on the button.</p><p>The crowd cheered as the supermodel slammed the contestant, saying: "Are you kidding me Sunny?"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I just wanted everyone to be a part of it," Sunny explained, looking downtrodden at his fate.</p><p>But the judges showed no sympathy, as Sofia yelled at the stage: "Goodbye!" with an angry expression.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/www-youtube-com-watch-v-835856584.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/image-37.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/image-35.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZ2qGeIKTaJigrF2brq%2B%2FjKCmqKuVl8KuvNJmrKehoaqybrzEq52oqp2Wu6SxjKOsnZ%2BVqHq0tM6comg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./addison-grace-20010321-html.html><span>←</span><span>Addison Grace (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
