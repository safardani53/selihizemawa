<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>The Bachelorette Star Nayte Olukoya Has Denied Cheating On Michelle Young</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Following his break up With Michelle Young, The Bachelorette’s Nayte Olukoya has denied cheating on her. Olukoya said that he “didn’t cheat,” but that he was “inexperienced un love.” On Sunday, June 26, he posted a long denial to his Instagram story. Olukoya issued the statement after some followers on social media claimed he had cheated on Michelle Young, causing the couple to split up. The former couple met in October 2021 while shooting The Bachelorette. They even got engaged on the season finale in December 2021 and planned to marry when the program finished.</p><h2>What did Nayte Olukoya of The Bachelorette say in his denial post?</h2><p>After Michelle Young announced her split with Nayte Olukoya on June 17, people suspected Olukoya had cheated on Young. Olukoya has now cleared the air and denied that infidelity was the cause of their breakup.&nbsp;The reality star issued a response in a two-part Instagram story post, with 15 bullet points denying the allegations. He began his article by disputing the presumption that he cheated on Young. He went on to say that a break-up does not always call for someone to be blamed. Olukoya also claimed to be a wonderful man, despite others labeling him a “red flag.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Nayte-Olukoya-3.jpg alt="Nayte Olukoya" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He also claimed that he thought Young was his “person,” but that he was “inexperienced not love.”&nbsp;Olukoya also addressed the story of him relocating to Minnesota to be closer to Young while they were dating in the article, claiming that the plan altered because the pair opted to get to know one other on a “deeper level” before taking the big step.</p><p>Nayte ended the post by saying that they both attempted to work on their relationship but that it did not work out, and that they were both devastated about it. He also said that he would never live his life based on “how others believe I should live it,” therefore putting an end to any conjecture.</p><h2>Concerning Michelle Young’s divorce announcement</h2><p>Young, who describes herself as “loyal, empathetic, and supportive,” joined The Bachelorette in search of a “partner by her side who is supportive and determined to make the world a better place.”&nbsp;The elementary school teacher from Minnesota was seeking “the Superman to her Superwoman” and someone with whom she could “create her own family.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Nayte-Olukoya-2-1.jpg alt="Nayte Olukoya" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>By the conclusion of the program, she had decided on Olukoya over Brandon and had proposed to him. The couple was excited to marry and have a family together, but after less than a year of being engaged, Young announced their divorce. The ex-couple announced their split on their Instagram story and requested privacy.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiroZ1dl66ktMSlpqudpKmybr%2FTmqlmppGuwaZ5zqWspKeplnqprdJmm56mmZqxbq%2FHnpitoZ6cerC6jKagnKCVobmmediorKefXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stars-who-have-never-won-an-oscar-2014252.html><span>←</span><span>Stars Who Have Never Won an Oscar, Academy Award</span></a>
