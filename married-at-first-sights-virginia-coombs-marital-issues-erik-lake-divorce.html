It's almost like we're holding it all in.”</p><p>The two decided to go to couple’s counseling, but she admitted it “wasn’t a miracle worker.”&nbsp;</p><p>She continued: “I didn't realize there would be so many things in a marriage that triggered my past memories that I haven’t worked through with past relationships and stuff in my childhood.</p><p>"That ends up leading to fights sometimes. Things can explode easily when you're in a vulnerable position.”</p><p>But she didn’t give up hope, as she said she “loves him” and can “still see a future with him" if they can come to that common ground.</p><p>Virginia added: “It scares me that there either is a common ground or we won't be able to find it.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>On <a href=#>Married at First Sight</a>, Erik struggled with Virginia’s hard-partying lifestyle, as he was upset when she revealed she often sleeps on male friend’s couches.&nbsp;</p><p>Virginia also had <a href=#>difficulty adjusting to Erik’s busy schedule as a pilot</a>.</p><p>They also struggled with their pets, as Erik is allergic to her cats and couldn’t convince his wife to not have them sleep in their bed.&nbsp;</p><p>As The Sun reported, the marriage didn’t last despite vowing to stay together on the Married at First Sight finale.</p><p>According to <a href=#>divorce documents filed in June</a>, Erik and Virginia have been living separately since April.</p><p>They said in a joint statement: "We've made best efforts to keep some parts of our relationship out of the public eye. This entire process has been difficult as is without the constant chatter of public opinion.</p><p>"Contrary to popular belief, we've been together and trying to make our marriage work since Decision Day.</p><p>"While we have decided to get a divorce, we aren't closing the doors on a possible future together.”</p><p>The couple added: "We love each other and will continue to navigate our new reality post show."&nbsp;</p><p>Couples Cam airs on Wednesdays at 10/9c on Lifetime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000676674176.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000640798841.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrZW2AdoKYaKSaqqKesqV5wK1kn6GiqMFuv8ign62rXau2s7PIp6CaZZOkvK6u0makmqqZqa6tecisqq6do2Kys7XKZqOao5VisarCzquanmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./south-west-train-services-cancelled-london-waterloo.html><span>←</span><span>London Waterloo station in rush hour chaos as South Western Railway trains cancelled and delayed</span></a>
