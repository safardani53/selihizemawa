Justin Duggar announced he is marrying Claire Spivey – and even <a href=#>formally joined her church</a>&nbsp;– on his 18th birthday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>This begs the obvious question: Did his father Jim Bob arrange this almost-child marriage between the two teens?</p><p>The family tends to marry young, but Justin proposed to Claire basically the moment that he became a legal adult.</p><p>As we all know, courtships – and marriages – must be approved by Jim Bob within the Duggar cult, er, community.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Due to psychological and social control but also financial leverage, JB retains and wields a s–t ton of power.</p><p>But though fans accuse Jim Bob of arranging a marriage for a barely legal child, is this really the case?</p><p>Justin’s soon-to-be mother-in-law insists it’s not.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/claire-spivey-picture-1020x1024.png><p>Hilary Spivey, who shared this image and others on Instagram, responded to a follower’s comment along those lines.</p><p>Claire’s mother asserted: "Jim Bob has never once arranged a marriage."</p><p>It’s unclear if she’s splitting hairs here about the definition of "arranged" or what, but she has a whole lot more to say.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"All of those kids have been equipped well for life," Hilary praised of the Duggar family, whose children have minimal life experience in society and little to no formal, real-world education.</p><p>"They can handle lots of responsibility at a young age," she went on to claim.</p><p>Hilary couldn’t resist taking a jab at a society that allows children to live thier own lives, adding: "unlike most of society today."</p><p>Ouch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As for Justin’s extreme youth, Hilary also offered up a half-explanation for why she feels that this is appropriate.</p><p>"Justin’s daddy told him that he knew he would marry young," Hilary recalls.</p><p>According to her, Jim Bob told him this "’cause he was so responsible."</p><p>"Trust me…" Hilary told the concerned followers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Of her (many, many) future in-laws, she concluded by writing:</p><p>"We’ve been blessed to know them for years."</p><p>Well, different people define different things as blessings, but the Spiveys and the Duggars clearly see eye to eye.</p><p>In a number of alarming ways.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Upon their surprise engagement, Justin and Claire shared a message of joy with the public.</p><p>“There is nothing comparable to finding the one you are meant to spend your life with," they gushed.</p><p>“We know we have found that in each other," the two teens claimed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"We cannot wait to be married," the pair raved after Justin popped the question to Claire.</p><p>"And," they continued, "are looking forward to a life together of faith in Christ, love for one another, and happiness!”</p><p>Naturally, fans were immediately concerned about the extreme young ages of these teens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>There are a number of complicated social factors at work behind the almost-child marriages within fundamentalist cults.</p><p>One is the emphasis upon fertility and reproduction.</p><p>Another is a cultural disinterest in education (combined with a tradition of getting jobs within the cult).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>With actual dating of any kind being banned and substituted with closely supervised courtships, there is also another factor.</p><p>We’re talking about getting them "settled" as adults before they have time to mature, or worse, develop an original thought.</p><p>And that is precisely how Derick Dillard, a Duggar in-law himself, explained why the Duggars marry so young.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When fans asked Der’s wife Jill why her baby-faced teenage brother is about to become a husband, he responded candidly.</p><p>"We want to have sex," Derick noted, a line that some mistook for a joke, but was clearly mostly if not entirely serious.</p><p>Fundamentalist teenagers are still teens, after all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The vast majority of these children have sex drives running rampant but no outlet (often, not even masturbation).</p><p>They will do anything, even saddle themselves for life to someone they barely know, just to pop their corks.</p><p>So to speak.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We’re not saying there’s no emotional attachment involved, or that Justin is getting married just so he can bone Claire.</p><p>But this is a well-documented phenomenon within these kinds of fundamentalist sects, and of toxic purity culture in general.</p><p>In this way, there is no escape from the family, or community.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It will be years before Justin and Claire are financially independent enough to make any real choices of their own.</p><p>Jim Bob may not have "arranged" this marriage in the literal sense, but he laid the foundation for it just the same.</p><p>He set things up to push his kids to either marry as soon as possible or risk permanent servant status like Jana.</p><p>Are we wrong?</p><ul
