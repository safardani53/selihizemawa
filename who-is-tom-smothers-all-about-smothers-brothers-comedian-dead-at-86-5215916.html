Tom’s death came after he announced he’d been diagnosed with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>stage two lung cancer.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>His younger brother and sidekick released a family statement through the National Comedy Center. “Tom was not only the loving older brother that everyone would want in their life, he was a one-of-a-kind creative partner,” Dick, 85, said. “I am forever grateful to have spent a lifetime together with him, on and off stage, for over 60 years. Our relationship was like<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> a good marriage</a> – the longer we were together, the more we loved and respected one another. We were truly blessed.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The National Comedy Center released its own statement on the loss, as well.&nbsp;“Tom was a true pioneer who changed the face of television and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>transformed our culture</a> with The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, which satirized politics, combated racism, protested the Vietnam War, and led the way for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Saturday Night Live</a>, The Daily Show, today’s network late night shows, and so much more,” they said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Find out everything you need to know about the life and legacy of Tom Smothers, co-star of <span id=The_Smothers_Brothers_Comedy_Hour_and_aftermath class=mw-headline><i>The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, </i>below.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>He Was From New York</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tom-smothers-ss-EMBED2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Thomas Bolyn Smothers III was born on February 2, 1937, in New York City. He was the son of homemaker <strong>Ruth Remick</strong> and <strong>Major Thomas B. Smothers,&nbsp;</strong>who as an army officer would ultimately die a prisoner of war of the Japanese in 1945. Tom and his family subsequently moved to Southern California, where he graduated from Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach.</p><h2>Tom Was Athletic</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>The young Tom Smothers was exceptionally physically active. According to his Wikipedia page, Tom was a competitive state champion in gymnastics, excelling on the parallel bars, and a competitive unicyclist as a high school student. He later attended San José State College, where he pole vaulted for the track team and competed in gymnastics.</p><h2>He Was Part of a John Lennon Hit</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Tom befriended <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>John Lennon</a></strong>. In 1969, he played acoustic guitars with the music legend while recording Lennon’s single with <strong>Yoko Ono</strong>, “Give Peace a Chance.”</p><h2>Tom Showed Up in Several Movies</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tom-smothers-ss-EMBED.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Comedy and music weren’t Tom’s only talents — he also had roles in major studio films, including <i>Get to Know Your Rabbit</i> (1972), <i>There Goes the Bride, </i>(1980), <i>Pandemonium, 1982, </i>and Serial (1980.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>On TV, however, Tom and his brother were lightning rods for controversy. The CBS boomer hit Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour pushed boundaries by sneaking in references to Vietnam and satirizing the establishment, among other hot button topics — a move that would land the show in hot water. It was ultimately cancelled in 1970, despite its popularity and high ratings.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Tom proved to be a vocal critic of censorship in the years to come.</p><h2>He Was a Father</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>According to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NPR</a>, Tom was married three times and had three children. He’s survived by children <strong>Riley Rose</strong> and <strong>Bo,</strong> and his wife, <strong>Marie Smothers</strong>. His son <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Thomas Bolyn Smothers IV </strong></a>(also known as Tom Jr) died in April of 2023, according to a publicly available obituary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LBsLmMrKSorJiav7R5wKWjZpmSpMK1edKmpq2glafAbq7RqKuhnaKoeqS7zJ6bopmeYrGmrcNmmK1laGt6dn6QbnBqbl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-tahiry-jose-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Tahiry Jose Dating Now</span></a>
