<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Fans Of RuPauls Drag Race React To The Elimination Decision In Episode 12: Another Week Withou</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Season 14, Episode 12 of RuPaul’s Drag Race</strong> has been a dramatic show thus far. It began with a brawl between Bosco and Lady Camden and finished with no one being eliminated once more.</p><p>Season 14 is the only one in which many episodes concluded with non-elimination outcomes. One of them was Episode 12, in which the judges and the “Drag Gods” chose to spare Bosco from being sent home.</p><p>Because Jorgeous and Bosco were in the bottom two, they were forced to compete in the infamous lip-sync fight. Jorgeous commanded the stage with her performance, which was well-received by the judges. Bosco would have been removed from the program if Jorgeous had been saved. However, instead of chocolate, she received a gold bar from the “Drag Gods,” which rescued her from being evicted.</p><p>Fans of Bosco were ecstatic with the outcome, although many wanted one of the queens to be sent home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/RuPauls-Drag-Race-episode-12-1.jpg><h2>How The Public Reacted</h2><p>In episode 12, the queens Bosco and Jorgeous were the judges’ least favorite acts. As a result, they had to compete in a lip-sync fight, and their song was Whitney Houston’s Heartbreak Hotel.</p><p>Jorgeous was elegant, as Bosco admitted in a confessional. The latter was convinced that a lip-sync fight with Jorgeous would send her packing. Gorgeous was RuPaul Charles’ favorite, according to Bosco. Thus she would not be eliminated.</p><p>Meanwhile, fans of RuPaul’s Drag Race were overjoyed to see Bosco return after getting the gold bar. The lack of eliminations was also a source of dissatisfaction among viewers.</p><h2>What occurred in episode 12 of RuPaul’s Drag Race?</h2><p>Season 14 Episode 12 of RuPaul’s Drag Race featured the queens in Moulin Ru: The Rusical, a musical based on Moulin Rouge.</p><p>The ladies were asked by RuPaul Charles to debate and choose their characters. Except for Lady Camden and Bosco, the contenders earned their parts after some negotiations. They both wanted to portray Saltine in the starring part. The part went to Bosco after a vote, leaving Camden with Mama Z’s persona.</p><p>Camden, interestingly, overpowered all other acts on stage, even Bosco’s Saltine. Her Mama Z was the show’s winner, while Bosco’s got her to the semifinals. The latter’s runway outfit was equally unimpressive, and judge Michelle Visage was irritated by her habit of wearing the same outfit week after week.</p><p>“Drag Gods,” on the other hand, rescued Bosco from packing her belongings. All seven participants, including Camden, Bosco, Daya Betty, Jorgeous, DeJa Skye, Willow Pill, and Angeria Paris VanMicheals, will be on RuPaul’s Drag Race in the upcoming episode.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>RuPaul's Drag Race</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>RuPaul’s Drag Race episode 12</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGidmqajYrynedGup5qtnKh6pb7AoGSrmZOaerOxwJyrZqyfYsGpsYyeo6KlmaOutbXOp2SdnZOewKq7zWagp2WVpba0u8OeZGpqXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-duggar-and-claire-spivey-did-jim-bob-arrange-their-barely.html><span>←</span><span>Did Jim Bob Arrange Barely Legal Marriage?</span></a>
