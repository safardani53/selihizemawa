Even though they’ve accepted being a dysfunctional family, the former NFL star was ready to&nbsp;turn a new leaf and heal&nbsp;their once restrained relationship. While stopping by the <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>podcast</a> to talk to us EXCLUSIVELY,&nbsp;Chad revealed that appearing on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition&nbsp;seemed like the perfect&nbsp;chance to do just that. “Well, the reason of me going was the opportunity for me to try to repair a relationship that was really never there in the first place, it was good,” he explained.&nbsp;“The experience was good.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>The former NFL wide receiver&nbsp;previously claimed&nbsp;his mother wasn’t there for him when he was young because of alcohol and drug abuse. Chad also didn’t have a father figure around when he was growing up. He revealed,&nbsp;“My biological father did a bid in the pen. I think he did like 23 years. He did a long time. He was in prison. And when he did get out, I think it was my 5th or 6th year in the NFL. I looked him up to find out who he was and got in contact with him and we had a couple of cigars, we talked a little bit, we caught up and of course, mom, she didn’t like that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“But the lessons– some of the things that I learned that her and I can work on, can be done away from the show to try to repair what we have going on,” Chad added. As far as&nbsp;his hopes for a future bride, he&nbsp;admitted that he’s worried about tying the knot. “To me, marriage and the rules that we are to abide by doesn’t fit everybody,” Chad&nbsp;said. “The actual rules… it doesn’t work like that and the individual I chose to do that with, we had our own set of rules and it just didn’t work out the way we wanted to. The divorce rate is ridiculous now, so I just want to stay away from that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Several stars also appear on the show with their loved ones including <strong>Kendra Wilkinson</strong>, 31, <strong>Farrah Abraham</strong>, 25, and more. They&nbsp;undergo intense counseling sessions and have to face their problems head on, helping them to decide&nbsp;whether to extend the olive branch or part ways!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition&nbsp;airs on Fridays, at 9pm on WeTV!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think Chad and his mom will get along better than ever now?
