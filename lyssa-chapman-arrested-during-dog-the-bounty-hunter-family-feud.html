Reports say that Lyssa has already been released.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>While it has been reported that Lyssa’s arrest was the result of her role in a family argument, we don’t know the specifics.</p><p>But when it comes to the topic of the argument, we do not have to guess.</p><p>Just days ago, video surfaced — having been taped last week — of <a href=#>Duane Chapman proposing to reported girlfriend Moon Angell</a>.</p><p>Earlier this month, he had described her as a "friend." In a teaser clip for Doctor Oz, he asked her to become his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Proposing marriage to your longtime family employee just seven months after laying your fifth wife to rest is … a lot.</p><p>Lyssa thinks that it’s too much, that Moon is taking advantage of her family.</p><p>She has shaded the woman multiple times on Twitter. At other times, she has directly called her out.</p><p>From Lyssa’s perspective, Moon has infiltrated her family and is taking advantage of her very vulnerable father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That’s not to say that Lyssa doesn’t think that her father is making some bad decisions, too.</p><p>"My dad is a GROWN ASS MAN," Lyssa recently tweeted. "His money. His dynasty."</p><p>"But you can guarantee that my name is not going down in history as a person who supported this," she explained.</p><p>As far as she is concerned, Moon is nothing but a snake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"If someone who met your family by dating your brother, tried to date your father after your step-mom died, what would you do?” she asked fans.</p><p>Her tweet early in January continued, illustrating how she felt that Moon was moving too fast and not being respectful.</p><p>“If you went to your mothers closet and saw she moved all her clothes and replaced them with her own," she wrote, "what would you do?"</p><p>Lyssa also took aim at Duane himself for his own behavior in what she says was retaliation — and worse — against her criticisms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to Lyssa Chapman, <a href=#>Duane tried to blackmail her</a> in order to silence her about Moon.</p><p>She claims that he called her and threatened to tell the world about her suicide attemtps if she did not back off.</p><p>Instead, Lyssa decided to ensure that neither he nor anyone else could hold this over her head by sharing the information herself.</p><p>Duane has not admitted to the blackmail attempt. The idea of a parent trying to blackmail their own child … well, it’s happened before, sadly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The entire Chapman family is still struggling to cope with Beth’s passing after she lost her battle with throat cancer.</p><p>For Lyssa, this means defending Beth’s memory — even if they had a complicated relationship — and trying to safeguard her family.</p><p>For Duane, struggling to cope may mean latching on to another source of love.</p><p>This summer, his grief sent him to the hospital. Loving again, even if it means a sixth wife, may feel like his only chance at keeping the will to live.</p><a href=#><img width=644 height=404 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/luke-perry-on-a-red-carpet.jpg alt="Luke Perry on a Red Carpet" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Celebrities Who Died in 2019: In Memoriam</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2V%2BcLjYrKqaZZOdrrG5wKdkmqqimsC1scNmm66qmaO0brDOoGStoJVir7DBza2wZqClo8GmvoyfmKahnK56p7HUnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tori-roloff-admits-shes-still-obsessed-with-zach-despite-marital-struggles.html><span>←</span><span>Tori Roloff Admits She's Still &amp;quot;Obsessed&amp;quot; with Zach Despite Marital Struggles</span></a>
