My 16-year-old grandson goes to college in Leeds city centre.

I want to know why he has been in prison 34 years? What has he done in there? What has changed? You just don’t get answers about anything. We are the ones with the life sentence."</p><p>It had taken search teams five hours to find Steven's body, with the young boy eventually discovered in&nbsp;Caulms Wood,&nbsp;Dewsbury, West Yorkshire.</p><p>The family has made a complaint on the parole decision, which has now been resubmitted, and they are awaiting a response.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Dewsbury MP Paula Sherriff said it was a "heartbreaking" case, saying: "I have written to the Victim Contact Service asking for a thorough investigation into why this was allowed to happen."</p><p>"I will leave no stone unturned in attempting to get their questions answered."</p><p>The Parole Board do not comment on specific cases.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfan55f5Nrb2irpJrDprqMpqylpJmjwG651Kubnqpdp7aktMCrm2aln6fBqrnEq2SrnZyarrSxw2aprqGeYrCpvsisq6aZo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andi-dorfman-blaine-hart-wedding.html><span>←</span><span>Andi Dorfman Cant Wait For Her Wedding With Blaine Hart</span></a>
