Instead, Jenny’s daughter and daughter-in-law were coming to visit.</p><p>Jenny has been looking forward to this reunion for two years.</p><p>But when Christina speaks up for her mom, Sumit wishes that she would stay out of it. After everything that his family has said and done … dude.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jenny Slatten and Sumit Singh’s segment of Season 7, Episode 12 opened in a doctor’s office.</p><p>Jenny had undertaken a fall while standing on something. Sumit had rushed home and taken her to urgent care.</p><p>Fortunately, Jenny did not seem to suffer any broken bones. But she was still in pain, which likely meant a torn ligament. That can happen at any age. For Jenny, in her sixties, healing could take a while.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Sumit has a fear of needles. He has passed out before — once from giving blood, twice while undergoing blood tests.</p><p>It is a little goofy to listen to him make Jenny’s injury and treatment all about him.</p><p>Obviously, Sumit doesn’t mean any harm. But it’s kind of funny to watch. At least he didn’t pass out, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>On to better things! With her arm healing and in a sling, she and Sumit went shopping for rings.</p><p>Jenny’s daughter, Christina, will be arriving with her wife, Jen. So Jenny wants to get Christina a gold ring.</p><p>She was particularly delighted that Indian jewelry tends to be 22 karat gold rather than a lower level of gold in the alloy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>While karat value can sometimes be a “less is more” matter, Jenny isn’t wrong to be happy. Especially when the ring that she selects is only a little over $100.</p><p>But Sumit explains to the camera that Jenny’s interest also aligns with Indian culture and values.</p><p>Simply put, he told viewers, “it’s good to wear gold.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Christina and Jen arrived, safe and sound. Jenny felt overjoyed, and embraced her daughter.</p><p>She also hugged Jen, and Sumit hugged both of them, but Jenny was very emotional.</p><p>That makes sense. It had, after all, been about two years since she’d seen them in person.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Sumit made food, which Christina and Jen appreciate after their flight.</p><p>The four of them take a seat, where Jenny presents the gift to her daughter. Christina absolutely loves the ring.</p><p>Jen doesn’t speak much — or, if she did, editors didn’t leave much of it in. Hey, not everybody’s talkative on camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Then Sumit told his daughters-in-law about his family. They are even worse now that they know that he married Jenny.</p><p>Sumit has, of course, vowed to regain their love and approval. But that sounds a lot like prioritizing their wishes over Jenny.</p><p>Christina emphasizes that she would love to see Sumit put Jenny first over the people attacking their marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But Sumit did not like hearing that. He insisted that Christina could not possibly understand his situation, and wished that she would butt out of it.</p><p>First of all, cultural nuance does not override everything. Sometimes right and wrong are what they are. That includes supporting your spouse. It also includes rejecting toxic people.</p><p>But also … after all of the interference (yelling, crying, screaming, and more) that Sumit’s family has done, how does Sumit have the gall to resent Christina’s take?</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z%2BcL%2FUpqCtZaOeu6i0jLCYp6yjYremus2yZKykkanBprrSZpuarZedwaa%2BjK2mZpqlqcFuu9StZKyglWKworrTZqynnJWnwLWtzZ1kprFdm66utcuyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./golnesa-gharachedaghi.html><span>←</span><span>Golnesa Gharachedaghi Biography</span></a>
