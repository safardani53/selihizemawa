The plan was for kit designers Umbro to honour their Newton Heath origins.</p><p>When they were formed under that name in 1878, they worse green and gold colours split down the middle on their shirts.</p><p>But, for some ridiculous reason when it came to promo time, players and even Sir Alex Ferguson decided to sport fake moustaches - as a nod to the style of that era.</p><p>What came out was something a bit daft - as this squad photo shows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/greenandgoldsquad.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000581134299.jpg><h2>GOING GREY IN 1995-96</h2><p>The infamous third kit that was seen as a curse for United.</p><p>Ryan Giggs and his cohorts wore it away at Southampton for a tough trip to The Dell.</p><p>Despite going into that game winning 11 of their last 12 games, they were mauled by the Saints and in particular, Matt Le Tissier,</p><p>Trailing 3-0 at half-time, Fergie ordered his charges to remove the strips and play in something else.</p><p>After the game, the excuse was made that the players couldn't pick each other out with a pass because the kit blended in with fans in the stands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000296452911.jpg><h2>GOING REVERSIBLE, 2001-02</h2><p>An economical trend, it was almost 20 years ago that United decided that their away kit and third strip could be made within the same jersey.</p><p>So, they went with a reversible top - one side was white and black, while the other was gold and black.</p><p>The collar was all sorts of wrong too and led to a strange v-neck.</p><p>Still, it matched David 'Goldenballs' Beckham's new moniker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000001832107-e1590493843694.jpg><h2>BLUE AND WHITE FOR 1990-91</h2><p>It's a kit that divides opinion, just like <a href=#>Arsenal's infamous bruised banana shirt</a>, which was also made by Adidas.</p><p>United's away strip from 1990-91 is either loved by fashionistas or detested by football fans who like their kits to look a bit more minimal.</p><p>It sported pointy blue shapes, and was matched by blue shorts and socks, while the customary Adidas stripes and trim were red.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000322763938-e1590493906838.jpg><h2>SPECIAL EDITION KIT 1990-91</h2><p>The same year United wore that Adidas number, they debuted a special edition kit for one game - the European Cup Winners' Cup final against Barcelona.</p><p>A 2-1 win over the Spanish giants just about glossed over what Bryan Robson, Lee Sharpe and Mark Hughes were wearing that day.</p><p>The shirt was all white, with a bizarre light grey pattern running through it.</p><p>Adidas stripes were represented in red on the sleeves, shorts and socks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000326145254.jpg><h2>FEELING BLUE IN 1992-93</h2><p>It's fair to say Umbro and United's relationship got off to a bad start.</p><p>This was the sports manufacturers first effort for the Red Devils, and was debuted for the 1992-93 season.</p><p>The deep blue colour was fine, but for some reason designers felt the need to have a graphic of the crest in black across the top, sleeves and the shorts.</p><p>Like we needed reminding this was Manchester United!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000001063433.jpg><h2>THE CHEVRON KIT, 2009-10</h2><p>In what was a bold change for United's kit designers, a black Chevron-like logo was added to their infamous home jersey for 2009-10.</p><p>It was an unnecessary addition many felt, who also associate the changing of the times with a more corporate United during this period, which isn't helped by the huge AIG logo plastered on the front.</p><p>Perhaps its saving grace is the round black collar, but it is a bit too radical.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000004531864.jpg><h2>GREEN GIANT, 1992-93</h2><p>Goalie jerseys are not exempt from this list.</p><p>Peter Schmeichel was charged with wearing some atrocious jerseys in his time between the sticks at Old Trafford.</p><p>This particular green jersey, with a Picasso-style artwork ticked around the front made for awful viewing.</p><p>Is it any wonder why the 'Great Dane' kept so many clean sheets in his time at United - strikers were blinded by his tops!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000001132661.jpg><h2>BACK TO BLUE, 1996-97</h2><p>Even Becks couldn't pull this look off.</p><p>United have worn blue in several commemorative shirts since they won the 1968 European Cup final in that colour.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">latest football features</h2></p><p>However, it hasn't always worked well for them, as this effort from 1996-97&nbsp; shows.</p><p>Not content with having a huge crest in the middle of the shirt, breaking with tradition, there's lines going in all sorts of angles connecting the shirt wth the sleeve.</p><p>What do you think is the worst kit out of this lot?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000000949130.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Manchester United star Jesse Lingard shows off his plush crib as part of new MTV series</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH5yg49yanJoX6Kur6%2FHnqqtnaJiwq%2B1056bZq%2Bfp8C1ecqiq2aklZa4cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katherine-mcnamara.html><span>←</span><span>Katherine McNamara Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</span></a>
