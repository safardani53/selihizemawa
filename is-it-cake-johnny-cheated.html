A contestant named Johnny Manganello has some feeling like he cheated his way through one of the challenges. What actually happened? Was it bad enough to get him eliminated from Is It Cake? Well, it's complicated.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why do fans think Johnny cheated on 'Is It Cake?'</h2><p>Unfortunately for Johnny, fans couldn't even make it through the first episode of Is It Cake? before they thought something was up with his dessert creation. Here, the contestants were tasked with making fast food replicas, and he chose to make tacos. However, he also made one comment that had people thinking he wasn't playing fair.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Johnny basically said that he went out of his way to fool the judges. "I don't want the decoys to look perfect, so I'm going to put some of my deep red tomatoes on one of them in hopes that they look fake," he shared. This got people talking on Twitter. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One person</a> said his being able to do this "defeats the purpose of the competition."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Many viewers felt like Johnny's trick wasn't fair, but there are some people who defended him, saying that what he did wasn't a big deal. "If he wasn’t allowed to alter the decoys, they would stop him," said one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter user</a>. They also pointed out that another contestant did something similar in a later episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On top of that, the Is It Cake? judges even suggested that the decoys could be changed to help make it harder to guess which one was actually a sweet treat. During the same challenge, Sam Cade made cheeseburger cakes and was told she should have put fake sesame seeds on all of the buns to make them harder to tell apart.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Johnny get eliminated from 'Is It Cake?'</h2><p>Because of his trick, Johnny was the only one from this challenge to fool the judges into thinking his taco was real. This meant that he won $5,000 and wasn't eliminated from the competition. However, that doesn't mean he was <a href=#>the winner</a>. Unfortunately for Johnny, he was eventually eliminated and didn't win the $50k cash prize.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Johnny is pretty active <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter</a> and has been interacting with the Is It Cake? fans since the show first aired.
