At the time, fans took issue with Kourtney&nbsp;for working with a fast fashion company. Many called the partnership hypocritical, considering Kourtney prides herself on being environmentally cautious and fast fashion brands spark a lot of ethical concerns.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“This is not one person’s problem,” Kourtney said during the Thursday episode. “This is a big problem in the world [and for] the whole fast fashion industry and the whole fashion industry.”&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kourtney-Kardashian-Addresses-Boohoo-Drama3.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Kourtney continued</span><span class=s4>:</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;“I feel like I learned so much doing the first collection. … I feel like hearing people’s feedback — as harsh as it might be —&nbsp;[was necessary], which is why I posted. I would love to learn more. I never said, ‘I am the queen of sustainability and I know it all.’ I would hope that they would see is that the fast fashion industry is the opposite of what you think when you think of sustainability.”&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s1>Kourtney went on to explain that shedding light on fast fashion “is the hardest place to start.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“So, I think it is such an amazing opportunity now beyond my collection — and hopefully as a company — to take all these things we were learning and researching [and do something about it].”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Kourtney went on to share that she views herself as a “vehicle” to “help make the change” with an opportunity to “push BooHoo further.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She continued</span><span class=s4>:</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;“I think anything that I want to put my time and energy into I want to do it the best way that I can and approach it with a lot of integrity. Fast fashion isn’t going anywhere, so why not push them to make these changes — even if they seem small to some — it is an improvement.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Hellisgo shared during the meeting&nbsp;</span><span class=s4>that</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;BooHoo immediately took consumer feedback into account</span><span class=s4>, saying,</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;“As a business, we listened. … We are actually reducing the amount of product we are bringing to the website at least by 20 percent.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Kourtney <a href=#>first addressed the complaints</a> via Instagram in September 2022.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I went back and forth about doing this collection with @boohoo because the first thing I think about when I hear the words ‘fast fashion’ is that it’s a bad for our planet,”&nbsp;</span><span class=s4>she </span><span class=s1>wrote alongside images of herself in pieces from her collection.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I invite any experts who have ideas, suggestions. I have already seen some of you and will absolutely be reaching out to talk and learn more,”&nbsp;Kourtney&nbsp;</span><span class=s4>continued</span><span class=s1>. “I want to help and from my experience so far working with the team I work with at Boohoo, they do too. I will be elaborating on their changes, how we’ve made this line more sustainable, and what I’ve learned we as consumers can do to help… all to come!!”</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s2>When&nbsp;Kourtney’s line and role with the company was announced, it was revealed that her clothing would feature “recycled fibers.” Additionally, she and BooHoo shared plans to document their journey on finding ways to reduce the brand’s carbon footprint.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakp6Wnwa%2Bx2GaimqqUlsCptcCnZKWdkae7prCMrKZmpaWYtW6y0aikZpqfpLWwu4ycpqWkkZd6pL7IraCcoaOifA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonathan-sims-7vqr-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jonathan Sims (Novelist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
