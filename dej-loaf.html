Dej was raised in Eastside Detroit. Her father was tragically killed when she was just four years old. She and her brothers lived with their grandmother after Dej’s mother suffered a breakdown, but they reunited a few years later. Dej’s father’s death influenced her to be a good kid, who mostly kept to herself as she grew up. Dej began writing music at nine years old. After she graduated from high school in 2009, she attended Saginaw Valley State University where she studied to be a nurse. She dropped out after three semesters to focus on a full-time music career in 2011. In 2013, Dej dropped her first mixtape, Just Do It. It caught&nbsp;the attention of rapper <strong>SAYITAINTTONE</strong>, who signed her to his label, IBGM, and to his management team. Dej released the track, “Try Me,” as a single in 2014. It was her breakthrough, as <strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Drake</a></strong> quoted lyrics from the song in an Instagram post. With her newfound popularity, Dej singed to Columbia records and released her Sell Sole mixtape in 2014. In 2015, she dropped her first EP, #AndSeeThatsTheThing.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Dej Loaf is best known as an American rapper, for her song “Try Me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Dej’s name is taken from her preferred footwear, a “loafer.” Dej’s sexuality has been in questions, as rumors claim she’s gay.
