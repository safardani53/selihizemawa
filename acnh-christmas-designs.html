Use these <a href=#>Christmas designs</a> created by other players to really make your island feel like you're walking in a winter wonderland. We've got clothes, signs, and more to make sure your island is as festive as ever.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rock a look that's not an ugly Christmas sweater.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Now, you can look like the reason for the season. We love an ugly Christmas sweater, but we don't need to wear them all the time. This one is the happy medium between the holiday season and something you can wear throughout the year.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gather all your best singers.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Remember the days when carolers were singing down every block? Now you can help bring that holiday nostalgia back with this sign on your island. Get a bunch of friends together and sing along to K.K. It even has a book so you don't forget the lyrics.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hang a classic wreath in your home.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Or on your simple panels. There are tons of wreaths and hangable options in the game, but at least this way you can choose a more traditional option that even gives you the choice of some festive candles.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Create a Christmas market.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Now that we have all these shopping items in the game, we might as well make a Christmas market! Put any items, DIYs, or baked goods up for sale but make sure you bake some cookies for Santa just in case he stops by.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Get an upgrade to Santa's coat.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Let's be honest — Santa has been around for years and his look hasn't changed much at all. But that's where Animal Crossing comes in! Let this be your excuse to give him the makeover he deserves, since he does so much for us every year.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Spruce up your stalls with this holly design.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Is it really Christmas if you don't make any holiday-themed stalls around your island? Of course, this design can be used for other purposes, but the holly really solidifies the Christmas feel.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Make a snow-covered stall with this design.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>With snow blanketing your island during the holiday season, you can add these stall designs for an extra snowy touch.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Or make a candy stall with this candy cane design.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>If you still have candy left over from the Halloween events (or you have other custom designs that would work with this), this candy cane design would make a perfect stall on your island.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Use this Christmas quilt design wherever you feel necessary!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Whether on the ground as a blanket or on a cushion, this Christmas quilt design is bound to make your island feel like you really pulled out all of the Christmas decorations.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This snowflake stone adds a subtle winter vibe to your island.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Since the background of this snowflake stone is transparent, you can add this stone to any stone paths you already have on your island for that extra holiday feeling.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Add these snowflakes to really sell the winter wonderland feel.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Even after the first snow has hit your island, you can make it feel even more like the holiday season by adding these snowflakes wherever you feel is necessary.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This ice would make a perfect ice rink.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Luckily, your island won't actually be covered in patches of slippery ice this winter, but this design is perfect for making an ice rink in a section of your island!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This cookie design adds to the holiday spirit.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twiiter</span></figure><p>Just because <a href=#>we can now cook in the game</a> doesn't mean you have to skip out on additional food designs — especially when it comes to what is arguably one of the best parts of the holiday season: cookies! Put this design on an outdoor table and it'll look like you're in the process of making yourself some cookies for Santa.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Make a tree farm and put this sign in front of it.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>The game's pine trees make a perfect Christmas tree farm! While chopping down these trees won't actually give you one to put in your home, you can at least pretend and make yourself a little Christmas tree farm.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">And some festive Christmas sweater designs spread more holiday cheer.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Second round of Christmas/Holiday designs!
