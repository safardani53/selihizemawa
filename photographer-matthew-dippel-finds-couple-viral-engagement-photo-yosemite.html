Help me find these two,” Dippel, a Michigan-based photographer, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote on Facebook</a> — where the picture racked up thousands of shares — on Oct. 17. “I took this photo and would love for them to find it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“A truly magical moment. Idk these people but maybe we can find em!” he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>added on Instagram</a>, where he garnered even more likes, before sharing with a growing audience on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Twitter</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite reaching thousands, the search for the couple didn’t end quickly though.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had countless people reach out during the search saying they know the couple, that it was their cousin, friend, so on and so forth. So I took anyone reaching out saying they know who it is with caution,” Dippel exclusively tells PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He shared his frustration on Twitter. “Still no luck,” he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote</a> two days after his initial posts. “A lot of people saying they found them but doesn’t turn out to be the right couple. If you honestly think you found them message me please!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Either this wonderful couple doesn’t want to be found (which I fully understand), or they don’t pay attention to social media and the news, thus living under a rock,” he added on Oct. 22.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His hope was waning by Oct. 25. “At this point I’m beginning to believe they have seen it and choose to remain unnamed,” he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>posted on Twitter</a>. “I will continue searching for a while, so don’t worry I’m not giving up, just not making it priority #1 anymore.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dippel’s search finally came to an end when he was put in touch with the couple, identified Charlie Bear and his fiancé Melissa.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: First Thing Man Hears In 6 Months Is A Proposal From His Husband-To-Be</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When Charlie’s brother reached out to me and actually connected me with Charlie and Melissa, I was still unsure it was them,” Dippel explains to PEOPLE. “They then provided me with time-stamped photos of them up there at the exact same time, wearing the same thing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The moment he realized that he had located the couple was celebratory. “So when I officially knew that it was them, a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders,” he recalls to PEOPLE. “I started jumping up and down in my basement because I had finally found them! I was so happy to get connected with them, and just to hear the gratitude in their voice was so heartwarming.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dippel shared the news with his followers over the weekend. “UPDATE: I FOUND THEM. Everyone meet, Charlie Bear and his fiancé Melissa the happy happy couple that was out on the point in my Taft Point Proposal,” he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote online</a>. “In short, I captured the second proposal, the more special and official one in Charlie’s words. Huge congratulations to you two. I wish I was able to meet you in person and hug you.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m glad I finally found you to share this special moment with you, thanks for being so awesome, maybe one day we will finally meet in person!” he added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple expressed their love of the photo on Instagram. “It us! Huge thank you once again to Matthew for capturing this special moment and taking the time to track us down,” Charlie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said</a>. “Also, a big thanks to all of the media outlets and inter-webs for spreading the word and all of the positive well wishes. Success!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We can’t thank Matt enough for all of his efforts in trying to find us! I’m still trying to comprehend all of this and half of me still doesn’t believe this actually has gone viral online! We love you all!!” Melissa <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>gushed</a>. “Now off to wedding planning!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e8%2Bhpq2nl6eusbTEq2SmmaSptabDjJ2gqaiVoXqntc2dqmabn6q9rbGMr6CrmZxisq%2BzwKCcpp2eqXqxtM6tpmaxn6iyrrXTnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nissan-micra-ev-model-2025.html><span>←</span><span>Nissan unveils new Micra EV model set to hit roads in 2025 as car marker plans electric Juke and Qas</span></a>
