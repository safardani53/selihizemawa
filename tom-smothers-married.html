Tom also had one son from his first marriage, Thomas Bolyn Smothers, who also died in 2023.</p><p>"Tom loved his mother, father, grandparents, and their lives and wisdom formed the basic values of his being," the obituary for Tom's son read. "Above all, he profoundly revered his son, the true love of his life, and passed on those values to him."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just saw the news of the passing of Tom Smothers.
