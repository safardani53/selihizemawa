He died as a result of cancer problems in his brain. Ryder Bachman, Bachman’s son, paid homage to his father on Facebook by sharing a black-and-white photo of himself with his father. He stated:</p><p>“My father died this afternoon. Thank to everybody for your warm remarks. I’m glad I got to spend some time with him in the end. Grab your loved ones and embrace them tight because you never know how long you have.”</p><p>Ryder proceeded to write about his father, claiming that his father’s last words were, “I love you, Paxton, Share the Music.” A jam session was also scheduled at the Fanny Bay Inn Jam, according to the post. This was followed by another post in which Ryder extended appreciation to everyone who came to jam:</p><p>“A huge thank you and big love to everyone who came out to the Fanny Bat Inn Jam this evening and danced, jammed, ate, drank, and showed me some love.” It’s been a difficult few of days, so I truly appreciate it.”</p><h2>Tim Bachman rose to prominence as a member of the Canadian rock band Bachman Turner Overdrive.</h2><p>Tim Bachman used to perform in several bands when he was younger, but he eventually acquired a job. He opted to pursue his musical career as his brother Randy was looking for a new band member for Brave Belt.&nbsp;Brave Belt was founded in 1971. Aside from Randy and Tim, the band also included Chad Allan, Robbie Bachman, and Fred Turner. Although Tim joined the Brave Belt, it was unable to continue its successful journey and suffered thousands of dollars in losses.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tim-Bachman-1.jpg alt="Tim Bachman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Brave Belt has only released two albums in its history, Brave Belt and Brave Belt II. Reprise Records issued both albums in 1971 and 1972. Never Coming Home, Another Way Out, Rock and Roll Band, Crazy Arms, Crazy Eyes, and Dunrobin’s Gone were among their tracks that charted in Canada.&nbsp;While Brave Belt was disbanding, Randy, Robbie, Tim, and Fred Turner formed the Bachman-Turner Overdrive in 1973. Tim contributed a couple of singles to the band’s first two albums, Bachman-Turner Overdrive and Bachman-Turner Overdrive II, which were released in 1973.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tim-Bachman-2.jpg alt="Tim Bachman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Tim Bachman left the band the next year to spend more time with his family and promote other gigs. However, according to the claims of the other members, he broke many rules, and as a result, he was kicked out of the band. In 1984, he returned.&nbsp;After a few albums, the band went on hiatus in 2005, and although Randy and Fred rejoined in 2009, the latter retired in 2018. Robbie died in January of 2023. At the time of his death, he was 69 years old.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiroqVdl66ktMyapWaokajAprCMmq6asV2WwW7Ax55kmp%2BVYryneZZqZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-real-housewives-of-atlanta-season-6-episode-13-recap-apollos.html><span>←</span><span>The Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 6 Episode 13 Recap: Apollo's Creed</span></a>
